<p>You might need to wait a few seconds for all of the graphics in this file to load.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-it-works"></a>
</h2>
<p>You import a mapfile from a built-in example file, a local excel file, from a S3 store, or from sql using <code><a href="../reference/load_mapfile.html">load_mapfile()</a></code></p>
<p>A family of functions <code>pipe_*</code> are provided (manipulate, calculate, hide, combine…) to implement successive filtering operations on a mapfile. These operations do not change the underlying data.</p>
<p>So you import/load data as a mapfile and all your work steps are then just applying successive filters.</p>
<p>Each filter returns another mapfile, suitably filtered.</p>
<p>Mapfiles, which are just lists of tables (actually, <code>tibbles</code>) with the class <code>mapfile</code>.</p>
<p>Statement tables are used in Causal Map as the underlying data which is to be coded into causal links. So each link refers to a quote from a particular statement. Statements are optional and this package can be used without them.</p>
<p>In this package, nodes are called <code>factors</code> and the edges are called <code>links</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="parser">Parser<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parser"></a>
</h2>
<p>All of these filters can be produced and edited either in a chain of actual R functions or in the simplified text format which is processed by the parser: <code>parse_commands</code>.</p>
<p>This parser takes text strings with a simpler command syntax as input and outputs one of these main functions for each line of text. This parser is used to read text commands from the input window in Causal Map Viewer and manipulate the output map with the corresponding functions. The input text can also consist of several lines, and the commands are applied one by one in sequence, in a pipeline of commands, such that after each command, such as each command starts with the map defined by the previous line and produces a new one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="output-functions">Output functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#output-functions"></a>
</h2>
<p>There are three output functions which are thin wrappers around visNetwork, DiagrammeR and DT, allowing a graph to be displayed using any of these three visualisation engines.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="additional-fields">Additional fields<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#additional-fields"></a>
</h3>
<p>Some of the commands such as path tracing create additional fields or variables for each factor and/or link. For example, when filtering by label, fields are created which can then be used to apply formatting.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="loading-example-datasets">Loading example datasets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#loading-example-datasets"></a>
</h2>
<p>(After loading CausalMapFunctions library)</p>
<p>The package ships with some example datasets, at the moment just these:</p>
<ul>
<li>example2</li>
<li>quip_example</li>
</ul>
<p>which you can also view in Causal Map on the web.</p>

so there is no change with regards to crops grown. However, the only change is that I have planted hybrid maize this 20xx/18 agricultural season as per the advice from the field worker from Organisation X. So I can forsee a bigger harvest than the years before. I have bought a goat from combined Organisation X money and social cash transfer money in October 20xx. I bought that goat to sell when it multiplies so that I can still survive even after these organizations stop helping us. Overall, the time spent on farm production has increased because with hybrid maize, extra care is needed to ensure a good harvest. I am planning on growing more maize in future to sell so that I can take care of my family.; Important link to  - Agric. Extension service: Grown hybrid for the first time and yields seem to be more than before; The household now plants early maturing varieties of maize to mitigate the impact of climate change which among other things results into inadequte rainfall in the area. Local varieties of maize were mostly late maturing and this was unsustainable because the rains stopped before the crops had matured and the family frequently faced food shortages. The family has also adopted the cultivation of other crops like potatoes, sorghum and beans just to make sure the household is food secure even if one crop fails to do well. The respondent said that they grow more maize and less sorghum. Growing many types fo crops has a cost of its own. The extra crops require extra gardens. The family does not own enough land. They rent extra land at K5,000 per growing season which they cannot easily afford as they have other critically important issues that need money. Over the past years the time spent on farmimg activities has reduced mainly because of the drought. Some crops failed to germinate and some gardens were bandoned hence reduction on labour demand for farming. Organizations like Organisation X are ewncouraging people like him to practice winter cropping to make up for the loss of yields due to droughts.; Important link to  - provide agriculture expertise: more yield for improved food security; The respondent was taught modern farming methods like \"Technique1\" which is a conservation agriculture technique. With this type of farming method, a small piece of land produces high yields compared to ordinary farming methods which the respondent has been using over the past years. Organisation X trained her and other beneficiaries on the use of modern farming methods to improve food security. This growing season she planted sorghum, maize, pearl millet (mchewere), groundnuts and sweet potatoes. Maize has not done well because of the fall army worms which damaged the crops in the field. She grew more maize because it is a staple food and grew less groundnuts due to shortage of farmimg land. All the crops are grown primarily for household consumption. Being an old lady, she says she is not very productive nowadays as her body is becomimg frail. The labour demand compels her to only cultivate a sizeable garden which she can manage to work on. Organisation X provided her with sweet potato stem cuttings so that she can plant in the swampy areas when the rains are over in order to be food secure.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","Comparatively, family has more income now and can afford the necessary quantities of food needed at household level than it used to be in the past. They no longer gather wild foods during the hungry months because the available cash is used to purchase food from the market. The social cash transfer program has brought about this change. Before this program sometimes the family would not afford three meals a day but now they are able to have three meals which include breakfast, lunch and supper.; There is more peace in the family now than before. Children are happy because they are able have regular meals.  In terms of decision making, she is the one who makes major financial decisions at the household. Household responsibilities are shared among the members notwithstanding their gender. Organisation X promotes gender equality and therefore beneficiaries have embraced the concept of sharing roles and responsibilities equally at the household.; She has enough food for household and her business is thriving since October 20xx. Overall, she is a happier person compared to previous years. Increased assets she has acquired is testimony of her improved wellbeing.; The relationship has improved over the past months because the children from this household are no longer food beggars in the community which was something that strained the relationship between parents. On the other hand, she claimed that her economic improvement has attracted some jealousy from people who do not wish her well. She is not allowed to benefit from other programs that offer financial assistance like the Organisation C Program in which people work on a community project and get paid. She is denied on account that she already benefiiting from the program implemented by Organisation X. \"You cannot have everything for yourself. Everybody needs money and you have to give a chance to other people to also benefit from other programs as you enjoy assistance from Organisation X\".","This beneficiary is also a member of a local Organisation B group where she saves her money. Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer program is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed under the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if saving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her income anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months she has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes, charcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She borrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back with an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that through this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.; I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?; I have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I get Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money to start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in the Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my money accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from Organisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the fish selling  business I am operating. My future plans are to expand my business by also selling tomatoes and bananas in addition to the fish I am already selling. I am planning on doing this because tomato selling and banana selling businesses are lucrative.","She has been able to buy a goat, household utensils, blankets, chickens, 3 iron sheets and other things. These are things she has just managed to buy since becoming a beneficiary of the social cash transfer implemented by Organisation X in 20xx.; Money received from the social cash transfer program every month is the main reason for this increased amount of household assets she has just bought recently.","The respondent said that during this past growing season he was able to dedicate more time to his farm work more than the previous years. Organisation X pays him K15,000 monthly. Part of this money was used to purchase hybrid maize seeds which are not only high yielding but also early maturing. Perviously he used to grow some local maize varieties because he could not afford to buy hybrid seeds on the market. Local varieties were mostly late maturing and low yielding and not suitable for an area which frequently faces unreliable rains. This year he grew maize, sorghum and sugarcanes. Sugarcane is the newest crop to be cultivated as a cash crop upon advice from Organisation X. He has cultivated it for the very first time.  He has grown more maize than sorghum this year because of late the latter has not been doing well up field because of drought. Maize is also grown through irrigation as this makes up for the loss caused by the drought. The respondent has also grown sweet potatoes whose cuttings were supplied by Organisation X to enhace foosd security at household level. The sweet potatoes are being grown along the river banks. Besides crop production, the respondent has bought a chicken for rearing to caution his income. Hr further intends to buy a goat for the same purpose. All these plans have come out of the trainings Organisation X has been offering to all the beneficiaries of their interventions.; The main reason for increased farm production has been financial assistance as well as extension advice from Organisation X. Financial stability has enable the respondent to dedicate more time working on his own gardens than going around looking for piece work.; She is able to buy some farm inputs like early maturing hybrid maize seeds for maximum yield production even though there could be erratic rains. The modern farming methods promoted by Organisation X are less less labour intensive and this allows her to grow other crops using time saved.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","I have embarked on a small business whereby I sell doughnuts in order to earn money, buy food and get other things. I got the capital for starting this business from the money I get per month from Organisation X. I am focusing more on my business than doing ganyus in the field to supplement my income. I no longer see the need for doing ganyus because I have the money I need to take care of my family and start up a small business. My plans for the future are that I would want to expand my business by selling beans which earn alot more than doughnuts. I would want to use the money realised from selling the beans to buy ironsheets for my house. I have always wanted to live in a house with ironsheets and that is my goal so far.; At present, we are doing businesses like selling tomatoes, cooking oil, sweetpotatoes and friters based on the advice from  Organisation X that we should invest our money in businesses so that we are financially independent. Most of us have stopped doing ganyu because we are busy running our businesses as taught by Organisation X.; Before embarking on such businesses which have stemmed from Organisation X's interventions, these men used to do a lot of ganyu labour including making grass thatched fetches for houses, working in farms and other types of ganyu.; NGOs are also giving people money like GOAL and Organisation X; as a result there are fewer people doing ganyus and more people doing small scale businesses because the money from the organizations is used as capital for their businesses.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically. Every week whenever she meets her friends in the Organisation B group they discuss issues that help promote prudent financial management.; Money earned from the social cash transfer has eased the pressure on expenditures as there is a guaranteed fixed amount of income each month paid to the respondent. The money realised from the business also helps  to increase the buying power of the household members. New assets have been bought like a radio and a memory card which provides entertainment to the household besides being a source of information.","There has been a change in the way decisions are made over food and money. I am the one in charge of this because I am the one earning more money at the household. Before Organisation X, it was my husband who made all the decisions with regards to food and money because he was the one that was earning more than me. With work sharing, I now go to sell my bananas whilst he goes to work in the garden. Before Organisation X, both of us would go to the garden to work together or both of us would be at home when there was no work in the garden. With regards to dealing with emergencies, I can comfortably use the money I get from my business earnings to solve these. Before Organisation X, I was helpless, I had nowhere to run to because people cannot help you with money in this community because of deep-seated trust issues people have over money.","Previously the household mostly survived on proceeds from ganyu labour. She used to got to Country A to work on the farms there for food. She would spend some few days away from the family. But since last year when she became a beneficiary of Organisation X's social cash transfer, she has not gone back to Country A for ganyu labour in order to feed the family. She has mostly relied on the cash handouts to buy food. She has also established a tomato selling business within the past few months to compliment the household income. Using proceeds from the cash handouts. the husband wants to start a fish selling business in the near future. The income from the sweet potato sells will also be channeled towards the establishment of new businesses and acquisition of assets.","The household is involved in small scale business like buying and selling of farm produce like cassava and sweet potatoes. They also do ganyu work but on a much smaller scale now compared to previous years. The family also receives monthly cash handouts from Organisation X worth K15,000 since October 20xx. Before this, the major source of income was piece work.; The respondent said that in addition to the normal farming, she has a kitchen garden where the family grows vegetables for consumption in order to improve nutrition in the household. This is something new and she learnt this from Organisation X field officers. She has also learned mixed cropping using modern farming methods like conservation agriculture which does not use the traditional ridges. Farmers use maize stalks for mulching in order to conserve moisture, avoid erosion and improve soil fertility. For the first time she planted hybrid maize seeds for the first time because she was able to purchase using part of her cash handouts she receives from Organisation X. She was advised by Organisation X extension officers to plant one seed per hole at 25cm apart and this system of planting maize is called Technique3. The crops are mainly grown for home consumption. She has also purchased a goat for the first time using the same source of income. Going foward she wants to expand crop production by acquiring more farming land through land rentals. This farming season, the respondent said she had no time for piece work unlike the previous years because she could afford to buy food using part of the cash handouts she gets monthly from Organisation X.; She is a fish  monger. She generates additional household income through selling fish. This is the first time she has ventured into this kind of business and has never been involved in any kind of business before as an income generating activity. Instead she used to fetch piece work across the border in Country A. In principle the fish mongering business has technically substituted her crossborder piece work adventures. The major income comes from the social cash transfer program by Organisation X and gets K15,000 monthly since October 20xx. \"To me the social cash transfer program feels like a dead father resurrecting to feed the hungry neglected children he left behind with nobody taking care of them\". This family used to gather wild foods in Mangochi in times of acute hunger but not anymore. They are able to generate income to buy food.; Apart from the selling of farm produce, the respondent has opened a shop. He sells groceries while his wife has started making and selling fritters (Mandasi). The business capital came from the monthly income he receives from Organisation X as a beneficiary of the Social Cash Transfer program. He also sells cooking oil in small quantities. He no longer engages in piece works as he has a business as an alternative money maker to compliment to the income he gets monthly  from Organisation X. Before joining the Social Cash Transfer Program in October 20xx, he used to survive on ganyu (piece work) in order to sustain his family.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","The main reason has been the income from the social cash transfer and the profits from her business which have helped to increase the combined value of the acquired assets at the household.; The savings she makes at the Organisation B group also qualifies her to borrow from the same and this money is used to buy some household assets. She also uses proceeds from her business to acquire assets.; The is accumulating assets and her income is increasing by the end of the day; Stable income sources like the social cash transfer and the small scale business she operates have given her more spending power hence she can now afford to buy more household assets than before.

She also had more time doing her on farm work than looking for casual labour elsewhere. The income she gets from Organisation X helped to fill the gap and she was able to sustain her household needs hence more time to concentrate on her own farming. She was able to plant high yielding and early maturing hybrid seeds which she bought from Agro dealers using money she gets from Organisation X.; For the first time in my life, I have bought hybrid maize seed and planted it in my garden last year. Previously, I used to plant local maize seed because it was readily available, and cheap. I have been able to switch to hybrid seed because there were lead farmers from Organisation X that taught us good agricultural practices and brought the hybrid seed closer to us at the market which was not the case before because the hybrid seed was only available at the boma in Nsanje. The lead farmers encouraged us to use hybrid seed because it produced more yields when compared against local maize seed varieties. I managed to buy this seed because of the money I received from Organisation X I should not lie to you. As you can see me, I cannot afford such seed on my own without assistance. Regarding livestock, I have bought chickens in the past 4 months using the money I got from Organisation X so that I sell them when they multiply. I would want to use the money from selling chickens to feed my children. i bought chickens because they are cheaper than goats yet one is able to make ends meet by selling them. I started receiving money from Organisation X in October and I get MK15000 per month. There are no changes on time spent on farm production as far as me and my household are Organisation Xed. My plans for the future are that I would want to buy a plot to cultivate more maize which I would sell and use the money to buy ironsheets for my house. Maize fetches alot of money here because it is a commodity that quickly becomes scarce once harvested due to the dry spells that we face every year.","There are no changes in decision making over food and money and no changes in work sharing because we have always worked together. At present, I am comfortably dealing with emergencies that require money due to the combined income from Organisation X and Social Cash Transfer; Before this money from Organisation X, I used to work with my children in our garden but now I can afford to hire labour for my garden. I can deal better with economic schocks than before because of the money I get monthly from Organisation X. In addition to that money, I am able to borrow from the Organisation B group whenever the need arises.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","The only change that has happened regarding the composition of my household is the fact that my son left in October to live with my brother because we were having economic problems and my brother decided to take my son to lessen the economic burden in my household. Regarding our health, we are stronger and healthier now because we are eating three times a day as a result of the money we receive from Organisation X.; She said that she and her son have enjoyed good health over the past year because of improved nourishment resulting from the bumper yield she realised last growing season due to the absence of natural disasters like floods which normally sweep the crops in the fields most of the time. She also said that improved sanitation at household level and general health education delivered by the Health Surveillance Assistant (HSA) of the community. The same HSA promotes health seeking behaviour among the community members and she is practising that by seeking healthcare as early as she notices signs of sickness. She accesses health care free at a government facility at Mbenje which is very close to her village. Sometimes she just buys drugs like painkillers in the shops when she has money. She further mentioned that she drinks treated water. The water source from which she draws water is disinfected with chlorine to prevent water borne illnesses.; The household composition has not changed over the past 12 months. The respondent revealed that she is taking ARVs at the moment and feels stronger than before because she can afford a meal daily nowadays. In the past her health was fast detoriating because she was taking drugs on an empty stomach as her household was food insecure. Since 20xx she has been receiving money from Organisation X and this cash handout has improved her health through sustained food availability. Other members of the household have all been in good health over the past year.; You can agree with me that when you are not eating enough food per day and if you are having unbalanced meals, sicknesses caused by malnutrition will be the order of the day. In the case of my household, there has been an improvement in our health because we can afford to eat balanced meals at least 3 times a day. Even my husband was advised by hospital personel to eat balanced meals so that his immune system is boosted. Now I see that he no longer complains of being sick because he eats balanced meals. We would not have afforded these meals had it not been for Organisation X through the money the organization gives us every month.; The only change in the composition of my household is the leaving of my son for Country A to do ganyu. He left last year October. With regards to the health of my household, there has been an improvement since we started receiving moey from Organisation X last year October. My children used to suffer from malnutrition but now they are strong and healthy because I can afford to provide a balanced diet for them using this MK 15000 i receive per month from Organisation X","The family is now able to buy food in times of need because they can now afford to do so using the money earned. The income he recieves cautions him against shocks like food shortages and natural disasters. The winter cropping championed by NGOs like Organisation X World Wide has ensured that they produce extra food like sweet potatoes after the rainy season.; Good rainfall and absence of natural disasters was the major reason for a better crop output in the field. Besides that, she also said that NGOs working in the area like Organisation E and Organisation X World Wide have been in the forefront advocating for the adoption of modern farming techniques in order to mitigate the impact of climate change which also affect agriculture production. \"We practice mixed cropping and after the rainy season we are encouraged to embark on irrigation farming. They sometimes give us early maturing varieties of maize and sweet potatoes. This made a difference by far\". Among other crops she grows gonkho (sorghum), pearl millet (mchewere), manduyi (groundnuts), chimbamba (beans) and rice. Apart from chickens she also rears ducks. All these compliment each other in terms of sustaining the household's income.Expert extension advice from NGOs regarding crop diversification motivated her to expand her agricultural enterprise.

i1b_important links to organisations, activity & change<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>I grow mazie always so there is no change with regards to crops grown. However,\nthe only change is that I have planted hybrid maize this 20xx/18 agricultural\nseason as per the advice from the field worker from Organisation X. So I\ncan forsee a bigger harvest than the years before. I have bought a goat from\ncombined Organisation X money and social cash transfer money in October 20xx.\nI bought that goat to sell when it multiplies so that I can still survive\neven after these organizations stop helping us. Overall, the time spent on\nfarm production has increased because with hybrid maize, extra care is needed\nto ensure a good harvest. I am planning on growing more maize in future to\nsell so that I can take care of my family.<\/br> Important link to - Agric.\nExtension service: Grown hybrid for the first time and yields seem to be more\nthan before<\/br> The household now plants early maturing varieties of maize\nto mitigate the impact of climate change which among other things results\ninto inadequte rainfall in the area. Local varieties of maize were mostly late\nmaturing and this was unsustainable because the rains stopped before the crops\nhad matured and the family frequently faced food shortages. The family has also\nadopted the cultivation of other crops like potatoes, sorghum and beans just\nto make sure the household is food secure even if one crop fails to do well.\nThe respondent said that they grow more maize and less sorghum. Growing many\ntypes fo crops has a cost of its own. The extra crops require extra gardens.\nThe family does not own enough land. They rent extra land at K5,000 per\ngrowing season which they cannot easily afford as they have other critically\nimportant issues that need money. Over the past years the time spent on farmimg\nactivities has reduced mainly because of the drought. Some crops failed to\ngerminate and some gardens were bandoned hence reduction on labour demand for\nfarming. Organizations like Organisation X are ewncouraging people like him to\npractice winter cropping to make up for the loss of yields due to droughts.<\/br>\nImportant link to - provide agriculture expertise: more yield for improved food\nsecurity<\/br> The respondent was taught modern farming methods like \"Technique1\"\nwhich is a conservation agriculture technique. With this type of farming method,\na small piece of land produces high yields compared to ordinary farming methods\nwhich the respondent has been using over the past years. Organisation X trained\nher and other beneficiaries on the use of modern farming methods to improve\nfood security. This growing season she planted sorghum, maize, pearl millet\n(mchewere), groundnuts and sweet potatoes. Maize has not done well because of\nthe fall army worms which damaged the crops in the field. She grew more maize\nbecause it is a staple food and grew less groundnuts due to shortage of farmimg\nland. All the crops are grown primarily for household consumption. Being an\nold lady, she says she is not very productive nowadays as her body is becomimg\nfrail. The labour demand compels her to only cultivate a sizeable garden which\nshe can manage to work on. Organisation X provided her with sweet potato stem\ncuttings so that she can plant in the swampy areas when the rains are over in\norder to be food secure.<\/p>","<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-7; mkf-11; mjf-12; mkf-3; mkf-6; ncm-19; nbm-21; nbf-15; nbf-17; nbm-18;\nmjm-4<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:10; 100; 124; 182; 248; 275; 277; 322; 324; 469; 517; 541; 579<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:; NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:f3_what is the main reason for this change?; d1_please tell me about the other\nthings your household does to earn money, food and to get other things?

I am the one who decides on how\nmoney is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X.\nWith regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly\nvisible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which\nwas not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly\non saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X\nand instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some\nof it at the Organisation B group. So far, I can easily borrow money from the\nOrganisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group,\nI could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not\ntrust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for ganyus to\nsolve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I\njust bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation\nX. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so\nthat I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my\ncommunity making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?<\/br>\nI have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I\nget Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money\nto start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in\nthe Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my\nmoney accumulates interest.

Perviously he used\nto grow some local maize varieties because he could not afford to buy hybrid\nseeds on the market. Local varieties were mostly late maturing and low yielding\nand not suitable for an area which frequently faces unreliable rains. This\nyear he grew maize, sorghum and sugarcanes.

He has grown more maize than sorghum this year\nbecause of late the latter has not been doing well up field because of drought.\nMaize is also grown through irrigation as this makes up for the loss caused by\nthe drought.

This is something new and she learnt this from\nOrganisation X field officers. She has also learned mixed cropping using modern\nfarming methods like conservation agriculture which does not use the traditional\nridges. Farmers use maize stalks for mulching in order to conserve moisture,\navoid erosion and improve soil fertility. For the first time she planted\nhybrid maize seeds for the first time because she was able to purchase using\npart of her cash handouts she receives from Organisation X. She was advised by\nOrganisation X extension officers to plant one seed per hole at 25cm apart and\nthis system of planting maize is called Technique3. The crops are mainly grown\nfor home consumption. She has also purchased a goat for the first time using\nthe same source of income. Going foward she wants to expand crop production\nby acquiring more farming land through land rentals. This farming season, the\nrespondent said she had no time for piece work unlike the previous years because\nshe could afford to buy food using part of the cash handouts she gets monthly\nfrom Organisation X.<\/br> Adoption of new farmimg techniques introduced by\nOrganisation X has improved crop output compared to previous years when she was\nusing local methods of farming. She also had more time doing her on farm work\nthan looking for casual labour elsewhere. The income she gets from Organisation\nX helped to fill the gap and she was able to sustain her household needs hence\nmore time to concentrate on her own farming. She was able to plant high yielding\nand early maturing hybrid seeds which she bought from Agro dealers using money\nshe gets from Organisation X.<\/br> For the first time in my life, I have bought\nhybrid maize seed and planted it in my garden last year. Previously, I used to\nplant local maize seed because it was readily available, and cheap. I have been\nable to switch to hybrid seed because there were lead farmers from Organisation\nX that taught us good agricultural practices and brought the hybrid seed closer\nto us at the market which was not the case before because the hybrid seed was\nonly available at the boma in Nsanje. The lead farmers encouraged us to use\nhybrid seed because it produced more yields when compared against local maize\nseed varieties. I managed to buy this seed because of the money I received from\nOrganisation X I should not lie to you. As you can see me, I cannot afford such\nseed on my own without assistance. Regarding livestock, I have bought chickens\nin the past 4 months using the money I got from Organisation X so that I sell\nthem when they multiply. I would want to use the money from selling chickens\nto feed my children. i bought chickens because they are cheaper than goats yet\none is able to make ends meet by selling them. I started receiving money from\nOrganisation X in October and I get MK15000 per month. There are no changes on\ntime spent on farm production as far as me and my household are Organisation\nXed. My plans for the future are that I would want to buy a plot to cultivate\nmore maize which I would sell and use the money to buy ironsheets for my house.\nMaize fetches alot of money here because it is a commodity that quickly becomes\nscarce once harvested due to the dry spells that we face every year.<\/p>","<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mkf-6; nbf-15<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:257; 478<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:g1_please tell me how relationships within your household have changed over the\nlast year?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>There are no changes in decision making over food and money and no changes\nin work sharing because we have always worked together.

Regarding our health, we are stronger and\nhealthier now because we are eating three times a day as a result of the money\nwe receive from Organisation X.<\/br> She said that she and her son have enjoyed\ngood health over the past year because of improved nourishment resulting from\nthe bumper yield she realised last growing season due to the absence of natural\ndisasters like floods which normally sweep the crops in the fields most of the\ntime. She also said that improved sanitation at household level and general\nhealth education delivered by the Health Surveillance Assistant (HSA) of the\ncommunity. The same HSA promotes health seeking behaviour among the community\nmembers and she is practising that by seeking healthcare as early as she notices\nsigns of sickness. She accesses health care free at a government facility at\nMbenje which is very close to her village. Sometimes she just buys drugs like\npainkillers in the shops when she has money. She further mentioned that she\ndrinks treated water. The water source from which she draws water is disinfected\nwith chlorine to prevent water borne illnesses.<\/br> The household composition\nhas not changed over the past 12 months. The respondent revealed that she is\ntaking ARVs at the moment and feels stronger than before because she can afford\na meal daily nowadays. In the past her health was fast detoriating because she\nwas taking drugs on an empty stomach as her household was food insecure. Since\n20xx she has been receiving money from Organisation X and this cash handout\nhas improved her health through sustained food availability. Other members of\nthe household have all been in good health over the past year.<\/br> You can\nagree with me that when you are not eating enough food per day and if you are\nhaving unbalanced meals, sicknesses caused by malnutrition will be the order\nof the day. In the case of my household, there has been an improvement in our\nhealth because we can afford to eat balanced meals at least 3 times a day. Even\nmy husband was advised by hospital personel to eat balanced meals so that his\nimmune system is boosted. Now I see that he no longer complains of being sick\nbecause he eats balanced meals. We would not have afforded these meals had it\nnot been for Organisation X through the money the organization gives us every\nmonth.<\/br> The only change in the composition of my household is the leaving\nof my son for Country A to do ganyu. He left last year October. With regards\nto the health of my household, there has been an improvement since we started\nreceiving moey from Organisation X last year October.

The family has also adopted the\ncultivation of other crops like potatoes, sorghum and beans just to make sure\nthe household is food secure even if one crop fails to do well. The respondent\nsaid that they grow more maize and less sorghum. Growing many types fo crops\nhas a cost of its own. The extra crops require extra gardens. The family does\nnot own enough land. They rent extra land at K5,000 per growing season which\nthey cannot easily afford as they have other critically important issues that\nneed money. Over the past years the time spent on farmimg activities has reduced\nmainly because of the drought. Some crops failed to germinate and some gardens\nwere bandoned hence reduction on labour demand for farming.

Organisation X pays\nhim K15,000 monthly. Part of this money was used to purchase hybrid maize seeds\nwhich are not only high yielding but also early maturing. Perviously he used\nto grow some local maize varieties because he could not afford to buy hybrid\nseeds on the market. Local varieties were mostly late maturing and low yielding\nand not suitable for an area which frequently faces unreliable rains. This\nyear he grew maize, sorghum and sugarcanes. Sugarcane is the newest crop to be\ncultivated as a cash crop upon advice from Organisation X. He has cultivated\nit for the very first time. He has grown more maize than sorghum this year\nbecause of late the latter has not been doing well up field because of drought.\nMaize is also grown through irrigation as this makes up for the loss caused by\nthe drought. The respondent has also grown sweet potatoes whose cuttings were\nsupplied by Organisation X to enhace foosd security at household level. The\nsweet potatoes are being grown along the river banks. Besides crop production,\nthe respondent has bought a chicken for rearing to caution his income. Hr\nfurther intends to buy a goat for the same purpose. All these plans have come\nout of the trainings Organisation X has been offering to all the beneficiaries\nof their interventions.<\/br> She is able to buy some farm inputs like early\nmaturing hybrid maize seeds for maximum yield production even though there could\nbe erratic rains. The modern farming methods promoted by Organisation X are\nless less labour intensive and this allows her to grow other crops using time\nsaved.<\/br> In the past people planted local maize but now they are using Hybrid\nseed because of extension worker advice from Organisation X and GOAL. These NGOs\nbrought the hybrid seed to nearby markets so that people can easily access them\nbecause previously we used to travel long distances to get the hybrid seed at\nthe Boma. Previously, we planted local millet but now we plant early maturity\nvarieties due to the dry spells that frequent our district.<\/br> Organisation X\nalso provided money to these beneficiaries to buy early maturing varieties as an\nimpact mitigation measure against the effects of the drought.<\/p>"]},"nodesToDataframe":true,"edgesToDataframe":true,"options":{"width":"100%","height":"100%","nodes":{"shape":"box","physics":true,"borderWidth":2,"font":{"color":"black"},"shadow":{"enabled":true,"size":10},"scaling":{"label":{"enabled":true,"min":14,"max":30}}},"manipulation":{"enabled":false},"edges":{"physics":false,"arrows":{"to":true},"arrowStrikethrough":true,"smooth":false,"shadow":true},"interaction":{"dragNodes":true,"dragView":true,"keyboard":false,"multiselect":true,"navigationButtons":true,"selectable":true,"selectConnectedEdges":false,"tooltipDelay":100,"zoomView":true,"hover":true,"zoomSpeed":1},"physics":{"solver":"barnesHut","maxVelocity":25,"stabilization":true,"barnesHut":{"avoidOverlap":0.9,"centralGravity":0.4,"damping":0.9}}},"groups":null,"width":null,"height":null,"idselection":{"enabled":true,"style":"width: 150px; height: 26px","useLabels":true,"main":"Select by id","values":[4,67,79,57,59,77,47,66,46,69,60,65,68,5,86]},"byselection":{"enabled":false,"style":"width: 150px; height: 26px","multiple":false,"hideColor":"rgba(200,200,200,0.5)","highlight":false},"main":null,"submain":null,"footer":null,"background":"white","export":{"type":"png","css":"float:right;","background":"whitesmoke","name":"export-network.png","label":"Save image"},"events":{"click":"function(data) {\n                Shiny.onInputChange('net_factor_click', data.nodes);\n                Shiny.onInputChange('net_link_click', data.edges);\n                ;}","select":"function(data) {\n                Shiny.onInputChange('net_factor_selected', data.nodes);\n                Shiny.onInputChange('net_link_selected', data.edges);\n                ;}","hoverNode":"function(nodes) {\n                Shiny.onInputChange('net_factor_hover', nodes);\n                ;}","blurNode":"function(nodes) {\n                Shiny.onInputChange('net_factor_click', null);\n                ;}","hoverEdge":"function(edges) {\n                Shiny.onInputChange('net_link_hover', edges);\n                ;}"},"opts_manipulation":{"datacss":"table.legend_table {\n  font-size: 11px;\n  border-width:1px;\n  border-color:#d3d3d3;\n  border-style:solid;\n}\ntable.legend_table td {\n  border-width:1px;\n  border-color:#d3d3d3;\n  border-style:solid;\n  padding: 2px;\n}\ndiv.table_content {\n  width:80px;\n  text-align:center;\n}\ndiv.table_description {\n  width:100px;\n}\n\n.operation {\n  font-size:20px;\n}\n\n.network-popUp {\n  display:none;\n  z-index:299;\n  width:250px;\n  /*height:150px;*/\n  background-color: #f9f9f9;\n  border-style:solid;\n  border-width:1px;\n  border-color: #0d0d0d;\n  padding:10px;\n  text-align: center;\n  position:fixed;\n  top:50%;  \n  left:50%;  \n  margin:-100px 0 0 -100px;  \n\n}","addNodeCols":["id","label"],"editNodeCols":["id","label"],"tab_add_node":"<span id=\"addnode-operation\" class = \"operation\">node<\/span> <br><table style=\"margin:auto;\"><tr><td>id<\/td><td><input id=\"addnode-id\"  type= \"text\" value=\"new value\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>label<\/td><td><input id=\"addnode-label\"  type= \"text\" value=\"new value\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table><input type=\"button\" value=\"save\" id=\"addnode-saveButton\"><\/button><input type=\"button\" value=\"cancel\" id=\"addnode-cancelButton\"><\/button>","tab_edit_node":"<span id=\"editnode-operation\" class = \"operation\">node<\/span> <br><table style=\"margin:auto;\"><tr><td>id<\/td><td><input id=\"editnode-id\"  type= \"text\" value=\"new value\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>label<\/td><td><input id=\"editnode-label\"  type= \"text\" value=\"new value\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table><input type=\"button\" value=\"save\" id=\"editnode-saveButton\"><\/button><input type=\"button\" value=\"cancel\" id=\"editnode-cancelButton\"><\/button>"},"tooltipStay":300,"tooltipStyle":"position: fixed;visibility:hidden;padding: 5px;white-space: nowrap;font-family: verdana;font-size:14px;font-color:#000000;background-color: #f5f4ed;-moz-border-radius: 3px;-webkit-border-radius: 3px;border-radius: 3px;border: 1px solid #808074;box-shadow: 3px 3px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);","highlight":{"enabled":false,"hoverNearest":true,"degree":{"from":5,"to":5},"algorithm":"hierarchical","hideColor":"rgba(200,200,200,0.5)","labelOnly":true},"collapse":{"enabled":false,"fit":false,"resetHighlight":true,"clusterOptions":null,"keepCoord":true,"labelSuffix":"(cluster)"}},"evals":["events.click","events.select","events.hoverNode","events.blurNode","events.hoverEdge"],"jsHooks":[]}</script><div id="htmlwidget-006a23569001108e7e10" style="width:700px;height:432.632880098888px;" class="visNetwork html-widget"></div>

so there is no change with regards to crops grown. However, the only change is that I have planted hybrid maize this 20xx/18 agricultural season as per the advice from the field worker from Organisation X. So I can forsee a bigger harvest than the years before. I have bought a goat from combined Organisation X money and social cash transfer money in October 20xx. I bought that goat to sell when it multiplies so that I can still survive even after these organizations stop helping us. Overall, the time spent on farm production has increased because with hybrid maize, extra care is needed to ensure a good harvest. I am planning on growing more maize in future to sell so that I can take care of my family.; Important link to  - Agric. Extension service: Grown hybrid for the first time and yields seem to be more than before; The household now plants early maturing varieties of maize to mitigate the impact of climate change which among other things results into inadequte rainfall in the area. Local varieties of maize were mostly late maturing and this was unsustainable because the rains stopped before the crops had matured and the family frequently faced food shortages. The family has also adopted the cultivation of other crops like potatoes, sorghum and beans just to make sure the household is food secure even if one crop fails to do well. The respondent said that they grow more maize and less sorghum. Growing many types fo crops has a cost of its own. The extra crops require extra gardens. The family does not own enough land. They rent extra land at K5,000 per growing season which they cannot easily afford as they have other critically important issues that need money. Over the past years the time spent on farmimg activities has reduced mainly because of the drought. Some crops failed to germinate and some gardens were bandoned hence reduction on labour demand for farming. Organizations like Organisation X are ewncouraging people like him to practice winter cropping to make up for the loss of yields due to droughts.; Important link to  - provide agriculture expertise: more yield for improved food security; The respondent was taught modern farming methods like \"Technique1\" which is a conservation agriculture technique. With this type of farming method, a small piece of land produces high yields compared to ordinary farming methods which the respondent has been using over the past years. Organisation X trained her and other beneficiaries on the use of modern farming methods to improve food security. This growing season she planted sorghum, maize, pearl millet (mchewere), groundnuts and sweet potatoes. Maize has not done well because of the fall army worms which damaged the crops in the field. She grew more maize because it is a staple food and grew less groundnuts due to shortage of farmimg land. All the crops are grown primarily for household consumption. Being an old lady, she says she is not very productive nowadays as her body is becomimg frail. The labour demand compels her to only cultivate a sizeable garden which she can manage to work on. Organisation X provided her with sweet potato stem cuttings so that she can plant in the swampy areas when the rains are over in order to be food secure.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","Comparatively, family has more income now and can afford the necessary quantities of food needed at household level than it used to be in the past. They no longer gather wild foods during the hungry months because the available cash is used to purchase food from the market. The social cash transfer program has brought about this change. Before this program sometimes the family would not afford three meals a day but now they are able to have three meals which include breakfast, lunch and supper.; There is more peace in the family now than before. Children are happy because they are able have regular meals.  In terms of decision making, she is the one who makes major financial decisions at the household. Household responsibilities are shared among the members notwithstanding their gender. Organisation X promotes gender equality and therefore beneficiaries have embraced the concept of sharing roles and responsibilities equally at the household.; She has enough food for household and her business is thriving since October 20xx. Overall, she is a happier person compared to previous years. Increased assets she has acquired is testimony of her improved wellbeing.; The relationship has improved over the past months because the children from this household are no longer food beggars in the community which was something that strained the relationship between parents. On the other hand, she claimed that her economic improvement has attracted some jealousy from people who do not wish her well. She is not allowed to benefit from other programs that offer financial assistance like the Organisation C Program in which people work on a community project and get paid. She is denied on account that she already benefiiting from the program implemented by Organisation X. \"You cannot have everything for yourself. Everybody needs money and you have to give a chance to other people to also benefit from other programs as you enjoy assistance from Organisation X\".","This beneficiary is also a member of a local Organisation B group where she saves her money. Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer program is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed under the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if saving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her income anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months she has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes, charcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She borrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back with an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that through this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.; I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?; I have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I get Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money to start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in the Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my money accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from Organisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the fish selling  business I am operating. My future plans are to expand my business by also selling tomatoes and bananas in addition to the fish I am already selling. I am planning on doing this because tomato selling and banana selling businesses are lucrative.","She has been able to buy a goat, household utensils, blankets, chickens, 3 iron sheets and other things. These are things she has just managed to buy since becoming a beneficiary of the social cash transfer implemented by Organisation X in 20xx.; Money received from the social cash transfer program every month is the main reason for this increased amount of household assets she has just bought recently.","The respondent said that during this past growing season he was able to dedicate more time to his farm work more than the previous years. Organisation X pays him K15,000 monthly. Part of this money was used to purchase hybrid maize seeds which are not only high yielding but also early maturing. Perviously he used to grow some local maize varieties because he could not afford to buy hybrid seeds on the market. Local varieties were mostly late maturing and low yielding and not suitable for an area which frequently faces unreliable rains. This year he grew maize, sorghum and sugarcanes. Sugarcane is the newest crop to be cultivated as a cash crop upon advice from Organisation X. He has cultivated it for the very first time.  He has grown more maize than sorghum this year because of late the latter has not been doing well up field because of drought. Maize is also grown through irrigation as this makes up for the loss caused by the drought. The respondent has also grown sweet potatoes whose cuttings were supplied by Organisation X to enhace foosd security at household level. The sweet potatoes are being grown along the river banks. Besides crop production, the respondent has bought a chicken for rearing to caution his income. Hr further intends to buy a goat for the same purpose. All these plans have come out of the trainings Organisation X has been offering to all the beneficiaries of their interventions.; The main reason for increased farm production has been financial assistance as well as extension advice from Organisation X. Financial stability has enable the respondent to dedicate more time working on his own gardens than going around looking for piece work.; She is able to buy some farm inputs like early maturing hybrid maize seeds for maximum yield production even though there could be erratic rains. The modern farming methods promoted by Organisation X are less less labour intensive and this allows her to grow other crops using time saved.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","I have embarked on a small business whereby I sell doughnuts in order to earn money, buy food and get other things. I got the capital for starting this business from the money I get per month from Organisation X. I am focusing more on my business than doing ganyus in the field to supplement my income. I no longer see the need for doing ganyus because I have the money I need to take care of my family and start up a small business. My plans for the future are that I would want to expand my business by selling beans which earn alot more than doughnuts. I would want to use the money realised from selling the beans to buy ironsheets for my house. I have always wanted to live in a house with ironsheets and that is my goal so far.; At present, we are doing businesses like selling tomatoes, cooking oil, sweetpotatoes and friters based on the advice from  Organisation X that we should invest our money in businesses so that we are financially independent. Most of us have stopped doing ganyu because we are busy running our businesses as taught by Organisation X.; Before embarking on such businesses which have stemmed from Organisation X's interventions, these men used to do a lot of ganyu labour including making grass thatched fetches for houses, working in farms and other types of ganyu.; NGOs are also giving people money like GOAL and Organisation X; as a result there are fewer people doing ganyus and more people doing small scale businesses because the money from the organizations is used as capital for their businesses.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically. Every week whenever she meets her friends in the Organisation B group they discuss issues that help promote prudent financial management.; Money earned from the social cash transfer has eased the pressure on expenditures as there is a guaranteed fixed amount of income each month paid to the respondent. The money realised from the business also helps  to increase the buying power of the household members. New assets have been bought like a radio and a memory card which provides entertainment to the household besides being a source of information.","There has been a change in the way decisions are made over food and money. I am the one in charge of this because I am the one earning more money at the household. Before Organisation X, it was my husband who made all the decisions with regards to food and money because he was the one that was earning more than me. With work sharing, I now go to sell my bananas whilst he goes to work in the garden. Before Organisation X, both of us would go to the garden to work together or both of us would be at home when there was no work in the garden. With regards to dealing with emergencies, I can comfortably use the money I get from my business earnings to solve these. Before Organisation X, I was helpless, I had nowhere to run to because people cannot help you with money in this community because of deep-seated trust issues people have over money.","Previously the household mostly survived on proceeds from ganyu labour. She used to got to Country A to work on the farms there for food. She would spend some few days away from the family. But since last year when she became a beneficiary of Organisation X's social cash transfer, she has not gone back to Country A for ganyu labour in order to feed the family. She has mostly relied on the cash handouts to buy food. She has also established a tomato selling business within the past few months to compliment the household income. Using proceeds from the cash handouts. the husband wants to start a fish selling business in the near future. The income from the sweet potato sells will also be channeled towards the establishment of new businesses and acquisition of assets.","The household is involved in small scale business like buying and selling of farm produce like cassava and sweet potatoes. They also do ganyu work but on a much smaller scale now compared to previous years. The family also receives monthly cash handouts from Organisation X worth K15,000 since October 20xx. Before this, the major source of income was piece work.; The respondent said that in addition to the normal farming, she has a kitchen garden where the family grows vegetables for consumption in order to improve nutrition in the household. This is something new and she learnt this from Organisation X field officers. She has also learned mixed cropping using modern farming methods like conservation agriculture which does not use the traditional ridges. Farmers use maize stalks for mulching in order to conserve moisture, avoid erosion and improve soil fertility. For the first time she planted hybrid maize seeds for the first time because she was able to purchase using part of her cash handouts she receives from Organisation X. She was advised by Organisation X extension officers to plant one seed per hole at 25cm apart and this system of planting maize is called Technique3. The crops are mainly grown for home consumption. She has also purchased a goat for the first time using the same source of income. Going foward she wants to expand crop production by acquiring more farming land through land rentals. This farming season, the respondent said she had no time for piece work unlike the previous years because she could afford to buy food using part of the cash handouts she gets monthly from Organisation X.; She is a fish  monger. She generates additional household income through selling fish. This is the first time she has ventured into this kind of business and has never been involved in any kind of business before as an income generating activity. Instead she used to fetch piece work across the border in Country A. In principle the fish mongering business has technically substituted her crossborder piece work adventures. The major income comes from the social cash transfer program by Organisation X and gets K15,000 monthly since October 20xx. \"To me the social cash transfer program feels like a dead father resurrecting to feed the hungry neglected children he left behind with nobody taking care of them\". This family used to gather wild foods in Mangochi in times of acute hunger but not anymore. They are able to generate income to buy food.; Apart from the selling of farm produce, the respondent has opened a shop. He sells groceries while his wife has started making and selling fritters (Mandasi). The business capital came from the monthly income he receives from Organisation X as a beneficiary of the Social Cash Transfer program. He also sells cooking oil in small quantities. He no longer engages in piece works as he has a business as an alternative money maker to compliment to the income he gets monthly  from Organisation X. Before joining the Social Cash Transfer Program in October 20xx, he used to survive on ganyu (piece work) in order to sustain his family.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","The main reason has been the income from the social cash transfer and the profits from her business which have helped to increase the combined value of the acquired assets at the household.; The savings she makes at the Organisation B group also qualifies her to borrow from the same and this money is used to buy some household assets.

She also had more time doing her on farm work than looking for casual labour elsewhere. The income she gets from Organisation X helped to fill the gap and she was able to sustain her household needs hence more time to concentrate on her own farming. She was able to plant high yielding and early maturing hybrid seeds which she bought from Agro dealers using money she gets from Organisation X.; For the first time in my life, I have bought hybrid maize seed and planted it in my garden last year. Previously, I used to plant local maize seed because it was readily available, and cheap. I have been able to switch to hybrid seed because there were lead farmers from Organisation X that taught us good agricultural practices and brought the hybrid seed closer to us at the market which was not the case before because the hybrid seed was only available at the boma in Nsanje. The lead farmers encouraged us to use hybrid seed because it produced more yields when compared against local maize seed varieties. I managed to buy this seed because of the money I received from Organisation X I should not lie to you. As you can see me, I cannot afford such seed on my own without assistance. Regarding livestock, I have bought chickens in the past 4 months using the money I got from Organisation X so that I sell them when they multiply. I would want to use the money from selling chickens to feed my children. i bought chickens because they are cheaper than goats yet one is able to make ends meet by selling them. I started receiving money from Organisation X in October and I get MK15000 per month. There are no changes on time spent on farm production as far as me and my household are Organisation Xed. My plans for the future are that I would want to buy a plot to cultivate more maize which I would sell and use the money to buy ironsheets for my house. Maize fetches alot of money here because it is a commodity that quickly becomes scarce once harvested due to the dry spells that we face every year.","There are no changes in decision making over food and money and no changes in work sharing because we have always worked together. At present, I am comfortably dealing with emergencies that require money due to the combined income from Organisation X and Social Cash Transfer; Before this money from Organisation X, I used to work with my children in our garden but now I can afford to hire labour for my garden.

Regarding our health, we are stronger and healthier now because we are eating three times a day as a result of the money we receive from Organisation X.; She said that she and her son have enjoyed good health over the past year because of improved nourishment resulting from the bumper yield she realised last growing season due to the absence of natural disasters like floods which normally sweep the crops in the fields most of the time. She also said that improved sanitation at household level and general health education delivered by the Health Surveillance Assistant (HSA) of the community. The same HSA promotes health seeking behaviour among the community members and she is practising that by seeking healthcare as early as she notices signs of sickness. She accesses health care free at a government facility at Mbenje which is very close to her village. Sometimes she just buys drugs like painkillers in the shops when she has money. She further mentioned that she drinks treated water. The water source from which she draws water is disinfected with chlorine to prevent water borne illnesses.; The household composition has not changed over the past 12 months. The respondent revealed that she is taking ARVs at the moment and feels stronger than before because she can afford a meal daily nowadays. In the past her health was fast detoriating because she was taking drugs on an empty stomach as her household was food insecure. Since 20xx she has been receiving money from Organisation X and this cash handout has improved her health through sustained food availability. Other members of the household have all been in good health over the past year.; You can agree with me that when you are not eating enough food per day and if you are having unbalanced meals, sicknesses caused by malnutrition will be the order of the day. In the case of my household, there has been an improvement in our health because we can afford to eat balanced meals at least 3 times a day. Even my husband was advised by hospital personel to eat balanced meals so that his immune system is boosted. Now I see that he no longer complains of being sick because he eats balanced meals. We would not have afforded these meals had it not been for Organisation X through the money the organization gives us every month.; The only change in the composition of my household is the leaving of my son for Country A to do ganyu. He left last year October. With regards to the health of my household, there has been an improvement since we started receiving moey from Organisation X last year October.

The income he recieves cautions him against shocks like food shortages and natural disasters. The winter cropping championed by NGOs like Organisation X World Wide has ensured that they produce extra food like sweet potatoes after the rainy season.; Good rainfall and absence of natural disasters was the major reason for a better crop output in the field. Besides that, she also said that NGOs working in the area like Organisation E and Organisation X World Wide have been in the forefront advocating for the adoption of modern farming techniques in order to mitigate the impact of climate change which also affect agriculture production. \"We practice mixed cropping and after the rainy season we are encouraged to embark on irrigation farming. They sometimes give us early maturing varieties of maize and sweet potatoes. This made a difference by far\". Among other crops she grows gonkho (sorghum), pearl millet (mchewere), manduyi (groundnuts), chimbamba (beans) and rice. Apart from chickens she also rears ducks.

The only change I have noticed is with respect to dealing with emergencies and shocks because now I can borrow from the Organisation B but before I used to go for ganyu.; I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?","The money Organisation X gives me is more than what I was making when doing ganyu. In addition to this, my household earnings have increased also because of the fritters that I sell. Not only this but also the fact that I save my money at the Organisation B means that my earnings are increasing.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","Let me not lie to you, the major source of money for me is the cash transfers I get from Organisation X. With my physical disability, I cannot carry tomatoes on my head to sell at the market because I crawl and cannot stand up straight. This money from Organisation X has been used to build my house and I am still saving some of that money for ironsheets. Before Organisation X, I was completely helpless. I had nowhere to run to because with my physical condition, it is not possible for me to do ganyu in the farms of other people. This month, I have started selling beer and it is easier for me because I do not have to move alot and I sell here at my house. The money I have used to start up this business is from Organisation X. I can say that I have engaged more in income generating activities than before because of this cash transfers from Organisation X. I have started up the beer-selling business because I want to buy the ironsheets for the house I build last year. I have bought 2 ducks and a chicken using the cash transfers from Organisation X for the purpose of selling these when they multiply.","The household now plants early maturing varieties of maize to mitigate the impact of climate change which among other things results into inadequte rainfall in the area. Local varieties of maize were mostly late maturing and this was unsustainable because the rains stopped before the crops had matured and the family frequently faced food shortages. The family has also adopted the cultivation of other crops like potatoes, sorghum and beans just to make sure the household is food secure even if one crop fails to do well. The respondent said that they grow more maize and less sorghum. Growing many types fo crops has a cost of its own. The extra crops require extra gardens. The family does not own enough land. They rent extra land at K5,000 per growing season which they cannot easily afford as they have other critically important issues that need money. Over the past years the time spent on farmimg activities has reduced mainly because of the drought. Some crops failed to germinate and some gardens were bandoned hence reduction on labour demand for farming. Organizations like Organisation X are ewncouraging people like him to practice winter cropping to make up for the loss of yields due to droughts.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","The respondent said that during this past growing season he was able to dedicate more time to his farm work more than the previous years. Organisation X pays him K15,000 monthly. Part of this money was used to purchase hybrid maize seeds which are not only high yielding but also early maturing. Perviously he used to grow some local maize varieties because he could not afford to buy hybrid seeds on the market. Local varieties were mostly late maturing and low yielding and not suitable for an area which frequently faces unreliable rains. This year he grew maize, sorghum and sugarcanes. Sugarcane is the newest crop to be cultivated as a cash crop upon advice from Organisation X. He has cultivated it for the very first time.  He has grown more maize than sorghum this year because of late the latter has not been doing well up field because of drought. Maize is also grown through irrigation as this makes up for the loss caused by the drought. The respondent has also grown sweet potatoes whose cuttings were supplied by Organisation X to enhace foosd security at household level. The sweet potatoes are being grown along the river banks. Besides crop production, the respondent has bought a chicken for rearing to caution his income. Hr further intends to buy a goat for the same purpose. All these plans have come out of the trainings Organisation X has been offering to all the beneficiaries of their interventions.; She is able to buy some farm inputs like early maturing hybrid maize seeds for maximum yield production even though there could be erratic rains. The modern farming methods promoted by Organisation X are less less labour intensive and this allows her to grow other crops using time saved.; In the past people planted local maize but now they are using Hybrid seed because of extension worker advice from Organisation X and GOAL. These NGOs brought the hybrid seed to nearby markets so that people can easily access them because previously we used to travel long distances to get the hybrid seed at the Boma. Previously, we planted local millet but now we plant early maturity varieties due to the dry spells that frequent our district.; Organisation X also provided money to these beneficiaries to buy early maturing varieties as an impact mitigation measure against the effects of the drought."],"color":["#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488"],"hashtags":["NA","NA",";

Organisation X trained\nher and other beneficiaries on the use of modern farming methods to improve\nfood security. This growing season she planted sorghum, maize, pearl millet\n(mchewere), groundnuts and sweet potatoes. Maize has not done well because of\nthe fall army worms which damaged the crops in the field. She grew more maize\nbecause it is a staple food and grew less groundnuts due to shortage of farmimg\nland. All the crops are grown primarily for household consumption. Being an\nold lady, she says she is not very productive nowadays as her body is becomimg\nfrail. The labour demand compels her to only cultivate a sizeable garden which\nshe can manage to work on.

She said that\nthrough this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.<\/\nbr> I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money\nI get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items\nwhich were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is\nmy husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning\nmore than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how\nmoney is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X.\nWith regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly\nvisible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which\nwas not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly\non saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X\nand instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some\nof it at the Organisation B group. So far, I can easily borrow money from the\nOrganisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group,\nI could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not\ntrust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for ganyus to\nsolve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I\njust bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation\nX. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so\nthat I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my\ncommunity making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?<\/br>\nI have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I\nget Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money\nto start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in\nthe Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my\nmoney accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from\nOrganisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the\nfish selling business I am operating.

Perviously he used\nto grow some local maize varieties because he could not afford to buy hybrid\nseeds on the market. Local varieties were mostly late maturing and low yielding\nand not suitable for an area which frequently faces unreliable rains. This\nyear he grew maize, sorghum and sugarcanes. Sugarcane is the newest crop to be\ncultivated as a cash crop upon advice from Organisation X. He has cultivated\nit for the very first time. He has grown more maize than sorghum this year\nbecause of late the latter has not been doing well up field because of drought.\nMaize is also grown through irrigation as this makes up for the loss caused by\nthe drought.

He sells\ngroceries while his wife has started making and selling fritters (Mandasi). The\nbusiness capital came from the monthly income he receives from Organisation X\nas a beneficiary of the Social Cash Transfer program. He also sells cooking oil\nin small quantities. He no longer engages in piece works as he has a business\nas an alternative money maker to compliment to the income he gets monthly from\nOrganisation X.

Previously, I used to\nplant local maize seed because it was readily available, and cheap. I have been\nable to switch to hybrid seed because there were lead farmers from Organisation\nX that taught us good agricultural practices and brought the hybrid seed closer\nto us at the market which was not the case before because the hybrid seed was\nonly available at the boma in Nsanje. The lead farmers encouraged us to use\nhybrid seed because it produced more yields when compared against local maize\nseed varieties. I managed to buy this seed because of the money I received from\nOrganisation X I should not lie to you. As you can see me, I cannot afford such\nseed on my own without assistance. Regarding livestock, I have bought chickens\nin the past 4 months using the money I got from Organisation X so that I sell\nthem when they multiply. I would want to use the money from selling chickens\nto feed my children. i bought chickens because they are cheaper than goats yet\none is able to make ends meet by selling them.

In the past I could\nnot afford to get these items which were important for household use.

I am the\none who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money\nfrom Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level,\nthere are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small\nscale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year.\nMost importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by\nOrganisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month,\nI save some of it at the Organisation B group. So far, I can easily borrow money\nfrom the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation\nB group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would\nnot trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for ganyus to\nsolve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I\njust bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation\nX. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so\nthat I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house.

Organisation X pays\nhim K15,000 monthly. Part of this money was used to purchase hybrid maize seeds\nwhich are not only high yielding but also early maturing. Perviously he used\nto grow some local maize varieties because he could not afford to buy hybrid\nseeds on the market. Local varieties were mostly late maturing and low yielding\nand not suitable for an area which frequently faces unreliable rains. This\nyear he grew maize, sorghum and sugarcanes. Sugarcane is the newest crop to be\ncultivated as a cash crop upon advice from Organisation X. He has cultivated\nit for the very first time. He has grown more maize than sorghum this year\nbecause of late the latter has not been doing well up field because of drought.\nMaize is also grown through irrigation as this makes up for the loss caused by\nthe drought. The respondent has also grown sweet potatoes whose cuttings were\nsupplied by Organisation X to enhace foosd security at household level. The\nsweet potatoes are being grown along the river banks. Besides crop production,\nthe respondent has bought a chicken for rearing to caution his income. Hr\nfurther intends to buy a goat for the same purpose. All these plans have come\nout of the trainings Organisation X has been offering to all the beneficiaries\nof their interventions.<\/br> She is able to buy some farm inputs like early\nmaturing hybrid maize seeds for maximum yield production even though there could\nbe erratic rains. The modern farming methods promoted by Organisation X are\nless less labour intensive and this allows her to grow other crops using time\nsaved.<\/br> In the past people planted local maize but now they are using Hybrid\nseed because of extension worker advice from Organisation X and GOAL. These NGOs\nbrought the hybrid seed to nearby markets so that people can easily access them\nbecause previously we used to travel long distances to get the hybrid seed at\nthe Boma.

past year. She  makes and sells fritters. She also benefits from the social cash transfer program being implemented by Organisation X in the area. She became a beneficiary in October 20xx. She gets K15,000 per month and used part of this money to start her fritters business. Apart from the Organisation X social cash transfer program, she is also a beneficiary of another social cash transfer program which started in 20xx and is being implemented by the government through Social Welfare. This income from government is erratic and sometimes beneficiaries can stay for 3 months without payment. But the one from Organisation X is the most guaranteed source of income for the household. Before becoming a Organisation X social cash transfer beneficiary last year, she used to do piece work for survival. She would spend several weeks in Country A to work on the farms so that she could earn money to sustain her family. But nowadays she is also able to earn money through selling tomatoes which she grows in her garden. She stopped doing piece work for a living courtesy of the interventions being implemented by Organisation X. She further disclosed that government cash transfer is shared among several people are identified by the village leadership without the knowledge of the benefactors. The actual beneficiary is just fronted as if all the income is for her/him yet when the money comes other people in the village get a share. In the end the intended purpose of alleviating poverty is defeated because after splitting the cash the beneficiary remains with too little money to make any meaningful impact. Since chiefs are responsible for selection of beneficiaries the system is abused from the beginning. But the Organisation X Wordwide social cash transfer is not being abused by the chiefs because selection of beneficiaries was done when they did own assessment for eligibility before recruitment.","She is a beneficiary of two social cash transfer programs being implemented by Organisation X and the government through the Social Welfare department. Organisation X pays her K15,000 monthly while the government pays her about K19,000 after three months or so of waiting and this figure fluctuates from time to time hence cannot mention exact amount. When she gets the government cash handout she shares it with other people who are not official beneficiaries in accordance with the agreement she made with the village headman during the beneficiary selection process.  Furthermore the fritters business which has been started out of the proceeds from Organisation X also gives her an extra income.","She is a beneficiary of two social cash transfer programs being implemented by Organisation X and the government through the Social Welfare department.

She is also engaged in business which generates more income for her household. This year, since she has produced more food, it will mean saving more income because the household will cut expenses on buying food.","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically. Every week whenever she meets her friends in the Organisation B group they discuss issues that help promote prudent financial management.","The household is involved in small scale business like buying and selling of farm produce like cassava and sweet potatoes. They also do ganyu work but on a much smaller scale now compared to previous years. The family also receives monthly cash handouts from Organisation X worth K15,000 since October 20xx. Before this, the major source of income was piece work.","Cash handouts from Organisation X has increased the amount of income for this household over the past year. The small scale business has also helped to boost household income though in a small way at the moment.","This beneficiary is also a member of a local Organisation B group where she saves her money. Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer program is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed under the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if saving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her income anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months she has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes, charcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She borrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back with an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that through this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.","She is able to generate her own income through the business she has started. She buys and sells farm produce. This is slowly giving her economic independence.","She is able to generate her own income through the business she has started. She buys and sells farm produce. This is slowly giving her economic independence.","The main reason has been the income from the social cash transfer and the profits from her business which have helped to increase the combined value of the acquired assets at the household.","The respondent said that in addition to the normal farming, she has a kitchen garden where the family grows vegetables for consumption in order to improve nutrition in the household. This is something new and she learnt this from Organisation X field officers. She has also learned mixed cropping using modern farming methods like conservation agriculture which does not use the traditional ridges. Farmers use maize stalks for mulching in order to conserve moisture, avoid erosion and improve soil fertility. For the first time she planted hybrid maize seeds for the first time because she was able to purchase using part of her cash handouts she receives from Organisation X. She was advised by Organisation X extension officers to plant one seed per hole at 25cm apart and this system of planting maize is called Technique3. The crops are mainly grown for home consumption. She has also purchased a goat for the first time using the same source of income. Going foward she wants to expand crop production by acquiring more farming land through land rentals. This farming season, the respondent said she had no time for piece work unlike the previous years because she could afford to buy food using part of the cash handouts she gets monthly from Organisation X.","She is a fish  monger. She generates additional household income through selling fish. This is the first time she has ventured into this kind of business and has never been involved in any kind of business before as an income generating activity. Instead she used to fetch piece work across the border in Country A. In principle the fish mongering business has technically substituted her crossborder piece work adventures. The major income comes from the social cash transfer program by Organisation X and gets K15,000 monthly since October 20xx. \"To me the social cash transfer program feels like a dead father resurrecting to feed the hungry neglected children he left behind with nobody taking care of them\". This family used to gather wild foods in Mangochi in times of acute hunger but not anymore. They are able to generate income to buy food.","She is a fish  monger.

This has been made possible because of the extra income from the social cash transfer as well as from the business proceeds. Before she became a beneficiary, food was scarce and sometimes the family would practice food rationing just to manage with the scarce resources available.","The household has mostly been spending money on food over the past few months and managed to save part of the remainder at the Organisation B group which was formed by Organisation X. This group comprises of benerficiaries supported by the same benefactor. Some money is used to buy assets like kitchen plates, washing basins and other utensils. She no longer owes any individual because since she became a member of the Organisation B group. She  has stopped borrowing money from people in her community. She now borrows from the same Organisation B group where she is a shareholder. This change has happened over the last couple of months since October 20xx.","The household has mostly been spending money on food over the past few months and managed to save part of the remainder at the Organisation B group which was formed by Organisation X.

She can now access a loan from her Organisation B group where she also buys shares weekly at a price of K300 per share.","Apart from the social cash transfer income the family gets monthly, they are also involved in other income generating activities like petty businesses. She makes and sells fritters to boost her income. This is a new business venture which she started after being urged to venture into other means of earning income other than cash handouts from Organisation X. She also has a vegetable garden where she produces vegetables for both household consumption and for sale. Initially, before becoming a beneficiary, she used to earn income through casual labour.","During the last year the household has been saving money through the Organisation B comprising of Organisation X beneficiaries only. She has also been saving money inform of assets like a goat. She is also able to access loans from the same Organisation B groups to finance her expenditures particularly using it as business capital or buying assets. Previously she could not save anything because her household income was low compared to this day.","Organisation B membership has given her more economic freedom through the savings and loans she gets.","The savings she makes at the Organisation B group also qualifies her to borrow from the same and this money is used to buy some household assets. She also uses proceeds from her business to acquire assets.","Previously the household mostly survived on proceeds from ganyu labour. She used to got to Country A to work on the farms there for food. She would spend some few days away from the family. But since last year when she became a beneficiary of Organisation X's social cash transfer, she has not gone back to Country A for ganyu labour in order to feed the family. She has mostly relied on the cash handouts to buy food. She has also established a tomato selling business within the past few months to compliment the household income. Using proceeds from the cash handouts. the husband wants to start a fish selling business in the near future.

Once she receives her monthly csah handout, she saves part of it in the Organisation B group by buying shares. Most of the expenditure was on food as the family has just passed through the hungry months. Some money has been used to buy hoes for farming, bought a black plastic sheet which she used to cover the roof of her house to avoid leakage during the rainy season. In times of shocks and emergencies the family borrows money from the Organisation B group.","It has improved because the husband and wife both spend more time at home together unlike in the past when either of them would go to Country A for days or weeks fetching ganyu labour. Now there is more shared responsibility between parents. They both equally look after the children the same way.

She has an alternative main source of income which is the monthly cash handout and business. With K15,000 per month she has been able to cater for her needs and used part of it to start her fritters business. Her children help her run this business. Most of this money earned is spent on food and groceries. She has also used part of it to buy school related items for her children. She owes nobody any money now because she is able to borrow from the  Organisation B group where she is a member. In this group she buys shares at the minimum price of K300 and sometimes buys a maximum of 5 shares at a time to increase her savings. Organisation X brought this Organisation B initiative and by virtuie of being a beneficiary of their interventions she joined the group.","She now has a stable source of income which has enabled her to make long term plans.

He also used conservation agricultural methods which lesrned from Organisation X extension officers. He grew more maize than any other crop because they consume it more than any food. This year's yield has been affected by the outbreak of fall worms but will still be better that what he produced last year on the same piece of land. Sorghum is mostly grown upland but most often it does not do well because of the drought as well as floods that are caused by runoff water from the mountains. Because of this setback he grows less of this crop. The family has no livestock at the moment but intends to buy a goat in the near future as part of income diversification strategy. To ensure food security the respindent said that he also plans to to embark on winter cropping along the irrigable land along the river. He has already been given sweet potato cuttings by Organisation X for the same purpose.

However, with Organisation X, I have also been selling sweetpotatoes because the organisation gave us some seedlings. In the years before last year, I would only sell maize but now I can also sell sweetpotatoes in addition to the maize. Most importantly, I have joined the Organisation B group in my village which is managed by Organisation X again. This has made a very big difference in my savings because before joining this Organisation B, I would rely on getting loans from my friends whenever I was facing an emergency. Accessing help from my friends was not guaranteed because some of my friends would tell me that they did not have the kind of money I needed.  Before last year, I used to drink alot such that I was not able to save any money. When I made my decision to quit drinking last year, I thought I would save the money I was using for drinking into a Organisation B group and use the money for worthwhile causes. What motivated me to join this Organisation B was the fact that I always saw my friends engaging in businesses and taking care of their families whilst I was unable to do so because I did not know how to save money. In the future, I would want to grow alot of beans so that I can earn more money than I am now because beans in this community fetch more money than any other crops including sweetpotatoes. For the sweetpotato, it is the seedlings that fetch more money on the market than the potatoes themselves. In this case I am also planning to sell sweetpotato seedlings.","As a household head and breadwinner, I used to spend more on beer in the period before last year. However, that has changed since I quit drinking last year and joined the Organisation B. I use the money for building my house which was not the case before. I can buy shoes for my children such that they no longer walk barefooted to school as was the case before I joined the Organisation B group. When I was drinking, those I was drinking with would dictate how I should spend my money but ever since I quit and joined the Organisation B, i am soley responsible for every decision that is made on spending in the household. I decided to quit drinking and join the Organisation B group because I was reflecting on how my peers were doing better than I was because they were saving money. The money we have as a family is saved in the Organisation B because it accumulates interest which can be used to buy household necessities including food as well as shelter by building a house which I am doing at the moment. Apart from myself, my wife and all my children are in Organisation B groups but they are not operated by NGOs. These are groups that are just created by people in the community. They have joined these community Organisation Bs in January and are yet to share out the money. My expectation is that the economic burden of meeting all their needs on an individual basis will be lessened. By joining the Organisation B group, I no longer have the need to borrow from my friends and no longer have the need to have debts because the money I get from the Organisation B caters for the many things that are needed in my household. I have not bought or sold any assets but I am planning on buying goats to replace those that were stolen last December. I would want to be rearing them and sell them when they multiply so that I can live a comfortable life and build my dream house.","There are no changes in decision making at household level as I have always dictated what should happen at household level. However, work sharing has changed because instead of my wife going to work in the garden by herself, I hire people to work in the garden because I can afford to pay them. I pay them using the money earned from the Organisation B group. There are no changes with regards to asset use. With regards to how shocks and emergencies are handled, I used to run to friends to borrow money from them before last year, but I do not do that anymore since I get more money from the Organisation B than my friends would lend me.","I used to do ganyu in other people's farms in the years before I started benefiting from Organisation X. Now I no longer see the need to do ganyu because I have the money which I receive every month from Organisation X to meet my needs.

In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems.

In terms of expenditure, most of the money is used to buy food while part of it is used to run businesses and also buying household assets. Household assets bought by many households include mats, cups, plates, blankets and school uniforms. \"It was a shame when you receive a visitor yet you have no mat and blanket for them to use overnight. It was really embarrassing. We were living like refugees in our own country. But Organisation X has opened our eyes\". They are hopeful that by next year they will manage to roof their houses with iron sheets.","Important link to  - Cash handouts: reduced time for piecework and improved

earns income through a small scale business she established\nwithin the past year. She makes and sells fritters. She also benefits from the\nsocial cash transfer program being implemented by Organisation X in the area.\nShe became a beneficiary in October 20xx. She gets K15,000 per month and used\npart of this money to start her fritters business. Apart from the Organisation\nX social cash transfer program, she is also a beneficiary of another social\ncash transfer program which started in 20xx and is being implemented by the\ngovernment through Social Welfare. This income from government is erratic and\nsometimes beneficiaries can stay for 3 months without payment. But the one\nfrom Organisation X is the most guaranteed source of income for the household.\nBefore becoming a Organisation X social cash transfer beneficiary last year,\nshe used to do piece work for survival. She would spend several weeks in Country\nA to work on the farms so that she could earn money to sustain her family.\nBut nowadays she is also able to earn money through selling tomatoes which\nshe grows in her garden. She stopped doing piece work for a living courtesy of\nthe interventions being implemented by Organisation X. She further disclosed\nthat government cash transfer is shared among several people are identified\nby the village leadership without the knowledge of the benefactors. The actual\nbeneficiary is just fronted as if all the income is for her/him yet when the\nmoney comes other people in the village get a share.

The money we have as a family is saved in the Organisation B because it\naccumulates interest which can be used to buy household necessities including\nfood as well as shelter by building a house which I am doing at the moment.\nApart from myself, my wife and all my children are in Organisation B groups\nbut they are not operated by NGOs. These are groups that are just created by\npeople in the community. They have joined these community Organisation Bs in\nJanuary and are yet to share out the money. My expectation is that the economic\nburden of meeting all their needs on an individual basis will be lessened. By\njoining the Organisation B group, I no longer have the need to borrow from my\nfriends and no longer have the need to have debts because the money I get from\nthe Organisation B caters for the many things that are needed in my household. I\nhave not bought or sold any assets but I am planning on buying goats to replace\nthose that were stolen last December. I would want to be rearing them and sell\nthem when they multiply so that I can live a comfortable life and build my dream\nhouse.<\/p>","<a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_edit_758\">Edit link<\/a><\/br><a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_delete_758\">Delete link<\/a><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:ncm-13<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:429<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:g1_please tell me how relationships within your household have changed over the\nlast year?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>There are no changes in decision making at household level as I have always\ndictated what should happen at household level.

She  makes and sells fritters. She also benefits from the social cash transfer program being implemented by Organisation X in the area. She became a beneficiary in October 20xx. She gets K15,000 per month and used part of this money to start her fritters business. Apart from the Organisation X social cash transfer program, she is also a beneficiary of another social cash transfer program which started in 20xx and is being implemented by the government through Social Welfare. This income from government is erratic and sometimes beneficiaries can stay for 3 months without payment. But the one from Organisation X is the most guaranteed source of income for the household. Before becoming a Organisation X social cash transfer beneficiary last year, she used to do piece work for survival. She would spend several weeks in Country A to work on the farms so that she could earn money to sustain her family. But nowadays she is also able to earn money through selling tomatoes which she grows in her garden. She stopped doing piece work for a living courtesy of the interventions being implemented by Organisation X. She further disclosed that government cash transfer is shared among several people are identified by the village leadership without the knowledge of the benefactors. The actual beneficiary is just fronted as if all the income is for her/him yet when the money comes other people in the village get a share. In the end the intended purpose of alleviating poverty is defeated because after splitting the cash the beneficiary remains with too little money to make any meaningful impact. Since chiefs are responsible for selection of beneficiaries the system is abused from the beginning. But the Organisation X Wordwide social cash transfer is not being abused by the chiefs because selection of beneficiaries was done when they did own assessment for eligibility before recruitment.","She is a beneficiary of two social cash transfer programs being implemented by Organisation X and the government through the Social Welfare department. Organisation X pays her K15,000 monthly while the government pays her about K19,000 after three months or so of waiting and this figure fluctuates from time to time hence cannot mention exact amount. When she gets the government cash handout she shares it with other people who are not official beneficiaries in accordance with the agreement she made with the village headman during the beneficiary selection process.  Furthermore the fritters business which has been started out of the proceeds from Organisation X also gives her an extra income.","She is a beneficiary of two social cash transfer programs being implemented by Organisation X and the government through the Social Welfare department.

Furthermore the fritters business which has been started out of the proceeds from Organisation X also gives her an extra income.","She earns money every month from Organisation X as well as from government through the social cash transfer programs. She is also engaged in business which generates more income for her household. This year, since she has produced more food, it will mean saving more income because the household will cut expenses on buying food.","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically. Every week whenever she meets her friends in the Organisation B group they discuss issues that help promote prudent financial management.","The household is involved in small scale business like buying and selling of farm produce like cassava and sweet potatoes. They also do ganyu work but on a much smaller scale now compared to previous years. The family also receives monthly cash handouts from Organisation X worth K15,000 since October 20xx. Before this, the major source of income was piece work.","Cash handouts from Organisation X has increased the amount of income for this household over the past year. The small scale business has also helped to boost household income though in a small way at the moment.","This beneficiary is also a member of a local Organisation B group where she saves her money. Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer program is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed under the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if saving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her income anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months she has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes, charcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She borrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back with an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that through this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.","She is able to generate her own income through the business she has started. She buys and sells farm produce. This is slowly giving her economic independence.","The main reason has been the income from the social cash transfer and the profits from her business which have helped to increase the combined value of the acquired assets at the household.","The respondent said that in addition to the normal farming, she has a kitchen garden where the family grows vegetables for consumption in order to improve nutrition in the household. This is something new and she learnt this from Organisation X field officers. She has also learned mixed cropping using modern farming methods like conservation agriculture which does not use the traditional ridges. Farmers use maize stalks for mulching in order to conserve moisture, avoid erosion and improve soil fertility. For the first time she planted hybrid maize seeds for the first time because she was able to purchase using part of her cash handouts she receives from Organisation X. She was advised by Organisation X extension officers to plant one seed per hole at 25cm apart and this system of planting maize is called Technique3. The crops are mainly grown for home consumption. She has also purchased a goat for the first time using the same source of income. Going foward she wants to expand crop production by acquiring more farming land through land rentals. This farming season, the respondent said she had no time for piece work unlike the previous years because she could afford to buy food using part of the cash handouts she gets monthly from Organisation X.","She is a fish  monger. She generates additional household income through selling fish. This is the first time she has ventured into this kind of business and has never been involved in any kind of business before as an income generating activity. Instead she used to fetch piece work across the border in Country A. In principle the fish mongering business has technically substituted her crossborder piece work adventures. The major income comes from the social cash transfer program by Organisation X and gets K15,000 monthly since October 20xx. \"To me the social cash transfer program feels like a dead father resurrecting to feed the hungry neglected children he left behind with nobody taking care of them\". This family used to gather wild foods in Mangochi in times of acute hunger but not anymore. They are able to generate income to buy food.","She is a fish  monger.

This family used to gather wild foods in Mangochi in times of acute hunger but not anymore. They are able to generate income to buy food.","The family now eats three meals a day. This has been made possible because of the extra income from the social cash transfer as well as from the business proceeds. Before she became a beneficiary, food was scarce and sometimes the family would practice food rationing just to manage with the scarce resources available.","The household has mostly been spending money on food over the past few months and managed to save part of the remainder at the Organisation B group which was formed by Organisation X. This group comprises of benerficiaries supported by the same benefactor. Some money is used to buy assets like kitchen plates, washing basins and other utensils. She no longer owes any individual because since she became a member of the Organisation B group. She  has stopped borrowing money from people in her community. She now borrows from the same Organisation B group where she is a shareholder. This change has happened over the last couple of months since October 20xx.","Monthly income from the social cash transfer and also from Organisation B borrowing. She can now access a loan from her Organisation B group where she also buys shares weekly at a price of K300 per share.","Apart from the social cash transfer income the family gets monthly, they are also involved in other income generating activities like petty businesses. She makes and sells fritters to boost her income. This is a new business venture which she started after being urged to venture into other means of earning income other than cash handouts from Organisation X. She also has a vegetable garden where she produces vegetables for both household consumption and for sale. Initially, before becoming a beneficiary, she used to earn income through casual labour.","During the last year the household has been saving money through the Organisation B comprising of Organisation X beneficiaries only. She has also been saving money inform of assets like a goat. She is also able to access loans from the same Organisation B groups to finance her expenditures particularly using it as business capital or buying assets. Previously she could not save anything because her household income was low compared to this day.","The savings she makes at the Organisation B group also qualifies her to borrow from the same and this money is used to buy some household assets. She also uses proceeds from her business to acquire assets.","Previously the household mostly survived on proceeds from ganyu labour. She used to got to Country A to work on the farms there for food. She would spend some few days away from the family. But since last year when she became a beneficiary of Organisation X's social cash transfer, she has not gone back to Country A for ganyu labour in order to feed the family. She has mostly relied on the cash handouts to buy food. She has also established a tomato selling business within the past few months to compliment the household income. Using proceeds from the cash handouts. the husband wants to start a fish selling business in the near future. The income from the sweet potato sells will also be channeled towards the establishment of new businesses and acquisition of assets.","Previously the household mostly survived on proceeds from ganyu labour.

She plans to diversify her business once she accumuates more capital in the near future and intends to buy and sell farm produce. Previously ganyu (piece work) was her main income generator but since she became a beneficiary of the social sach transfer program by Organisation X, she has reduced dependence on ganyu. She has an alternative main source of income which is the monthly cash handout and business. With K15,000 per month she has been able to cater for her needs and used part of it to start her fritters business. Her children help her run this business. Most of this money earned is spent on food and groceries. She has also used part of it to buy school related items for her children. She owes nobody any money now because she is able to borrow from the  Organisation B group where she is a member. In this group she buys shares at the minimum price of K300 and sometimes buys a maximum of 5 shares at a time to increase her savings. Organisation X brought this Organisation B initiative and by virtuie of being a beneficiary of their interventions she joined the group.","We used to go to Country A for ganyu so that we could earn money, find food and get other things that are needed at household level.

She grows more maize than sorghum because sorghum is grown upland which is not fertile enough while maize is growing along the river banks after the rains which are more fertile. Last growing season she did not produce enough because she spent most of her time caring for a sick relative during the planting season.

In the main garden he has grown  maize, sorghum, sweet potatoes and pearl millet (mchewere). Unlike the previous years, the respondent said that he applied compost manure to his crops. He also used conservation agricultural methods which lesrned from Organisation X extension officers. He grew more maize than any other crop because they consume it more than any food. This year's yield has been affected by the outbreak of fall worms but will still be better that what he produced last year on the same piece of land. Sorghum is mostly grown upland but most often it does not do well because of the drought as well as floods that are caused by runoff water from the mountains.

I no longer see the need for doing ganyus because I have the money I need to take care of my family and start up a small business. My plans for the future are that I would want to expand my business by selling beans which earn alot more than doughnuts. I would want to use the money realised from selling the beans to buy ironsheets for my house. I have always wanted to live in a house with ironsheets and that is my goal so far.","Before Organisation X, I only used the money I earned primarily on food. Now with my business, I also use it for buying materials required for making the doghnuts. I have also managed to buy plates which we use in my home. In addition to that, I have also bought some Chickens which I would be selling for food and extra income when they multiply. I can also afford to buy school uniforms for my children which was not the case before the money I get from Organisation X. However, I have not sold any assets during this period. I have been the one who decides on spending since my husband does not live with us; he lives with another wife. I save some of the money I make from my business in my house but the huge chunk of it goes into the Organisation B group because I want to get more money when we share out this coming October. Since the money in Organisation B accumulates interest, I would want to use it to buy ironsheets. The changes with the Organisation B are only based on the fact that I can borrow money easily from the group when I need it. The benefit of this Organisation B will be fully realised when we share out the money in October.","Important link to Organisation X - Cash Transfer: Started a business, bought assets like chickens and kitchen utensils, bought school uniforms and improved nutrition status at household level","Let me not lie to you, the major source of money for me is the cash transfers I get from Organisation X. With my physical disability, I cannot carry tomatoes on my head to sell at the market because I crawl and cannot stand up straight. This money from Organisation X has been used to build my house and I am still saving some of that money for ironsheets. Before Organisation X, I was completely helpless. I had nowhere to run to because with my physical condition, it is not possible for me to do ganyu in the farms of other people. This month, I have started selling beer and it is easier for me because I do not have to move alot and I sell here at my house. The money I have used to start up this business is from Organisation X. I can say that I have engaged more in income generating activities than before because of this cash transfers from Organisation X. I have started up the beer-selling business because I want to buy the ironsheets for the house I build last year. I have bought 2 ducks and a chicken using the cash transfers from Organisation X for the purpose of selling these when they multiply.","I did not have purchasing power before this program of receiving money from Organisation X. I could not buy anything. Now, I can happily say I have managed to spend some of that money on buying livestock like 2 goats, 2 ducks and a chicken. I have bought these livestock for the purpose of selling them when they multiply in the near future. There are no changes in the decision making because I am the head of this household. With the coming of Organisation X, I have started saving money through the Organisation B group ran by Organisation X. Before this organisation came in this village, I never had any money to save but because of the monthly cash transfers I am getting, I am able to save some of it with the Organisation B group so that I would use the money to finish up building my house and even use some of it to boost my beer selling business.","Important link to Organisation X - Cash Transfer: I have built a house, bought 2 goats, 2 ducks and a chicken, started beer selling business and improved the nutrition of my household.","I have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I get Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money to start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in the Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my money accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from Organisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the fish selling  business I am operating. My future plans are to expand my business by also selling tomatoes and bananas in addition to the fish I am already selling. I am planning on doing this because tomato selling and banana selling businesses are lucrative.","I have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something.

Regarding new crops I have grown this season, for the first time, I have grown groundnuts which were made available at our market by Organisation X. I have grown groundnuts because they fetch alot of money once sold and they are nutritious. I have also grown sugarcane this season for the purpose of selling them to earn extra income based on the advice by Organisation X that we have to be self-dependent. In the case of livestock, I have bought 3 chickens this year in February so that I sell them when they multiply. I used the part of the money I receive per month from Organisation X to buy these chickens. Overall, the time I spend with farm production has increased because I am no longer doing ganyu. The advice on good agricultural practices from Organisation X has also meant that I spend more time with farm production than before where I would pay little attention to my crops and I would not follow proper procedures in farming. In future, I would want to get a tradle pump or engine pump to engage in irrigation farming and grow onions and tomatoes which fetch alot of money here.","I have opened a tuckshop last month (February) to earn income and I have grown sugarcanes which will be ready for selling this coming May or June. I used the money from Organisation X to start-up these business ventures. Before I started benefiting from Organisation X, I used to rely on ganyu for income as well as food; but now I no longer do ganyu because I have enough money to take care of my needs and my business also keeps me busy these days. Overall, my time spent on income generation activities has increased becasue I spend everyday working either in my sugarcane garden or in my tuckshop unlike before where it was not everyday that one would find ganyu.With regards to my plans for the future, I am planning on starting a fish-selling business because fish fetches alot of money in this community.","I have opened a tuckshop last month (February) to earn income and I have grown sugarcanes which will be ready for selling this coming May or June.

I have been able to eat better than before, I have also managed to start a tuckshop business and bought household items. All these were hardly possible in the past because the money was never sufficient to meet the basic needs of my household.","Important link to  - Cash Transfer: This is the main reason for my changed status. I can buy things, invest money and take care of my family through this money","At present, we are doing businesses like selling tomatoes, cooking oil, sweetpotatoes and friters based on the advice from  Organisation X that we should invest our money in businesses so that we are financially independent. Most of us have stopped doing ganyu because we are busy running our businesses as taught by Organisation X.","At present, we are doing businesses like selling tomatoes, cooking oil, sweetpotatoes and friters based on the advice from Organisation X that we should invest our money in businesses so that we are financially independent. Most of us have stopped doing ganyu because we are busy running our businesses as taught by Organisation X.","In the past we would rely on going to Country A for ganyu but with Organisation X, we have stopped.","As regards to the assets sold, we have sold maize, beans and soya in order to find money when we are stranded. However, the majority have sold these in order to earn extra income not because they are in dire situations.","The money from the Organisation B is used as capital for businesses. The Organisation B has also made it easy for us to borrow money when we are stranded. In the past before Organisation X, it was only those who were already well-to-do who could borrow from MARDEF but with these Organisation Bs, even poor people like us have a chance of accessing loans from the group. As a result of this improved access to loans, poverty levels have dwindled, people have bought items like beds which they could not have afforded before Organisation X.","Important link to  - Organisation B: Access to loans has improved, people have started businesses with loans from the Organisation B","Before embarking on such businesses which have stemmed from Organisation X's interventions, these men used to do a lot of ganyu labour including making grass thatched fetches for houses, working in farms and other types of ganyu.","They also buy shares at the Organisation B group which enables them to borrow money from the same to buy whatever they need including starting up small scale businesses. If the beneficiary is the wife, she borrows money from the Organisation B group and engages in a small scale business. The profits made from the business cater for other family needs at the household.","Currently more volumes of food are consumed in the households than during the past years because they have harvested more yield this time owing to modern farmimg techniques imparted by Organisation X and also because of increased household income which they are able to use to buy food.","NGOs are also giving people money like GOAL and Organisation X; as a result there are fewer people doing ganyus and more people doing small scale businesses because the money from the organizations is used as capital for their businesses.","NGOs are also giving people money like GOAL and Organisation X; as a result there are fewer people doing ganyus and more people doing small scale businesses because the money from the organizations is used as capital for their businesses.","Land is a scarce resource and some people do not have farming land of their own in this community.  Those who do not have own land for farming rent from others . The rental fee varies but the minimum is K6,000 per growing season. In the past those who wanted to rent a piece of land had to go for piece work to raise money for the rental. But this has changed over the past year as some of the beneficiaries have been able to pay this rental fee without doing any ganyu.","Before they became beneficiaries of the social cash transfer program, they used to earn income through piece work or other menial jobs. Some of them used to sell reeds, ropes, fish traps or thatching grass. After becoming beneficiaries they said a lot has changed in the past year. For example, people have set up businesses and are also saving their income in the Organisation B group. Most of them have started shops while others sell agricultural commodities like bananas. Their spouses mostly make and sell fritters. They said that income generated by their dependants is not included as part of the household income because it never forms part of the household budget.

earns income through a small scale business she established\nwithin the past year. She makes and sells fritters. She also benefits from the\nsocial cash transfer program being implemented by Organisation X in the area.\nShe became a beneficiary in October 20xx. She gets K15,000 per month and used\npart of this money to start her fritters business. Apart from the Organisation\nX social cash transfer program, she is also a beneficiary of another social\ncash transfer program which started in 20xx and is being implemented by the\ngovernment through Social Welfare. This income from government is erratic and\nsometimes beneficiaries can stay for 3 months without payment. But the one\nfrom Organisation X is the most guaranteed source of income for the household.\nBefore becoming a Organisation X social cash transfer beneficiary last year,\nshe used to do piece work for survival. She would spend several weeks in Country\nA to work on the farms so that she could earn money to sustain her family.\nBut nowadays she is also able to earn money through selling tomatoes which\nshe grows in her garden. She stopped doing piece work for a living courtesy of\nthe interventions being implemented by Organisation X. She further disclosed\nthat government cash transfer is shared among several people are identified\nby the village leadership without the knowledge of the benefactors. The actual\nbeneficiary is just fronted as if all the income is for her/him yet when the\nmoney comes other people in the village get a share. In the end the intended\npurpose of alleviating poverty is defeated because after splitting the cash the\nbeneficiary remains with too little money to make any meaningful impact. Since\nchiefs are responsible for selection of beneficiaries the system is abused from\nthe beginning. But the Organisation X Wordwide social cash transfer is not being\nabused by the chiefs because selection of beneficiaries was done when they did\nown assessment for eligibility before recruitment.<\/p>","<a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_edit_16\">Edit link<\/a><\/br><a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_delete_16\">Delete link<\/a><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-7<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:5<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:d3_what is the main reason for this change?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>She is a beneficiary of two social cash transfer programs being implemented\nby Organisation X and the government through the Social Welfare department.\nOrganisation X pays her K15,000 monthly while the government pays her about\nK19,000 after three months or so of waiting and this figure fluctuates from\ntime to time hence cannot mention exact amount.

However, there are no cahnges in the health of the household.","The only change that has happened regarding the composition of my household is the fact that my son left in October to live with my brother because we were having economic problems and my brother decided to take my son to lessen the economic burden in my household. Regarding our health, we are stronger and healthier now because we are eating three times a day as a result of the money we receive from Organisation X.","Respondent sells firewood which she collects from the mountain forest as a source of income generation. She also does piece work but now on a very small small scale compared to previous years. She also receives monthly income from Organisation X as a beneficiary of the Social Cash Transfer program. She also said that she receives remmittances from her relatives who work in town. The social cash transfer program which she joined in October 20xx has guaranteed her stable and consistent income which has helped to alleviate some problems faced by her household.","I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?","There has been a change in the way decisions are made over food and money. I am the one in charge of this because I am the one earning more money at the household. Before Organisation X, it was my husband who made all the decisions with regards to food and money because he was the one that was earning more than me. With work sharing, I now go to sell my bananas whilst he goes to work in the garden. Before Organisation X, both of us would go to the garden to work together or both of us would be at home when there was no work in the garden. With regards to dealing with emergencies, I can comfortably use the money I get from my business earnings to solve these. Before Organisation X, I was helpless, I had nowhere to run to because people cannot help you with money in this community because of deep-seated trust issues people have over money.","The only change in the composition of my household is the leaving of my son for Country A to do ganyu. He left last year October. With regards to the health of my household, there has been an improvement since we started receiving moey from Organisation X last year October. My children used to suffer from malnutrition but now they are strong and healthy because I can afford to provide a balanced diet for them using this MK 15000 i receive per month from Organisation X","There are no changes in the decision making at household level Organisation Xing food and money but childcare has changed because now I can take care of my children in the absence of my wife because Organisation X has told us to be mindful of gender equality. With regards to asset use, there are no changes. However, when it comes to dealing with emergencies, there are changes because, before Organisation X came in, I would borrow money from my friends but that is no longer the case because I have the money to help me even in emergencies. If I happen not to have it, then I borrow from the Organisation B.","Important link to Organisation X - Organisation B: I can easily access loans to meet emergencies. I am expecting to taste the real benefits of this in October 20xx when we share out the money","We go to Organisation B to find loans when faced with shocks. Before Organisation X, we would rely on going for ganyu or borrowing from friends when stranded and in most cases we would not acces the needed money due to trust issues.","Dealing with emergencies has changed because the money is now easily borrowed from the Organisation Bs managed by Organisation X and GOAL unlike in the past where we would ask from friends which was not easy."],"color":["#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488"],"hashtags":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"width":[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],"label":["","","","","","","","","",""],"link_memo":["","","","","","","","","",""],"smooth.roundness":[0.00160571776733076,0,0.118938878797829,0.171606660173192,-0.00663586033394249,0.423884728190876,0,-0.106494679317417,0,0.218611167389776],"smooth.enabled":[true,false,true,true,true,true,false,true,false,true],"smooth.type":["diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross"],"link_id":[213,318,593,803,811,954,985,997,1035,1107],"title":["<a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_edit_213\">Edit link<\/a><\/br><a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_delete_213\">Delete link<\/a><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-1<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:142<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:b1_please tell me about any changes in the composition and health of your\nhousehold during the last year.<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>My cousin left in October last year to live with my other relatives because of\nthe poor economic situation we were facing.

I have seen people in my community\nmaking a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?<\/p>","<a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_edit_811\">Edit link<\/a><\/br><a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_delete_811\">Delete link<\/a><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:nbf-14<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:453<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:g1_please tell me how relationships within your household have changed over the\nlast year?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>There has been a change in the way decisions are made over food and money.

This has improved production because from the same piece of land the respondent is expecting more yield compared to the previuos years she has been farming.","The main reason for the changes in farming practices during the past growing season has been the adoption of new farming techniques like \"Technique1\" and Technique2 method of planting maize (planting one maize seed per hole unlike 3 seeds per hole which is a traditional way).

She  makes and sells fritters. She also benefits from the social cash transfer program being implemented by Organisation X in the area. She became a beneficiary in October 20xx. She gets K15,000 per month and used part of this money to start her fritters business. Apart from the Organisation X social cash transfer program, she is also a beneficiary of another social cash transfer program which started in 20xx and is being implemented by the government through Social Welfare. This income from government is erratic and sometimes beneficiaries can stay for 3 months without payment. But the one from Organisation X is the most guaranteed source of income for the household. Before becoming a Organisation X social cash transfer beneficiary last year, she used to do piece work for survival. She would spend several weeks in Country A to work on the farms so that she could earn money to sustain her family. But nowadays she is also able to earn money through selling tomatoes which she grows in her garden. She stopped doing piece work for a living courtesy of the interventions being implemented by Organisation X. She further disclosed that government cash transfer is shared among several people are identified by the village leadership without the knowledge of the benefactors. The actual beneficiary is just fronted as if all the income is for her/him yet when the money comes other people in the village get a share. In the end the intended purpose of alleviating poverty is defeated because after splitting the cash the beneficiary remains with too little money to make any meaningful impact. Since chiefs are responsible for selection of beneficiaries the system is abused from the beginning. But the Organisation X Wordwide social cash transfer is not being abused by the chiefs because selection of beneficiaries was done when they did own assessment for eligibility before recruitment.","the respondent earns income through a small scale business she established within the past year.

They no longer gather wild foods during the hungry months because the available cash is used to purchase food from the market. The social cash transfer program has brought about this change. Before this program sometimes the family would not afford three meals a day but now they are able to have three meals which include breakfast, lunch and supper.; There is more peace in the family now than before. Children are happy because they are able have regular meals.  In terms of decision making, she is the one who makes major financial decisions at the household. Household responsibilities are shared among the members notwithstanding their gender. Organisation X promotes gender equality and therefore beneficiaries have embraced the concept of sharing roles and responsibilities equally at the household.; She has enough food for household and her business is thriving since October 20xx. Overall, she is a happier person compared to previous years. Increased assets she has acquired is testimony of her improved wellbeing.; The relationship has improved over the past months because the children from this household are no longer food beggars in the community which was something that strained the relationship between parents. On the other hand, she claimed that her economic improvement has attracted some jealousy from people who do not wish her well. She is not allowed to benefit from other programs that offer financial assistance like the Organisation C Program in which people work on a community project and get paid. She is denied on account that she already benefiiting from the program implemented by Organisation X. \"You cannot have everything for yourself. Everybody needs money and you have to give a chance to other people to also benefit from other programs as you enjoy assistance from Organisation X\".","This beneficiary is also a member of a local Organisation B group where she saves her money. Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer program is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed under the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if saving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her income anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months she has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes, charcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She borrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back with an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that through this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.; I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?; I have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I get Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money to start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in the Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my money accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from Organisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the fish selling  business I am operating. My future plans are to expand my business by also selling tomatoes and bananas in addition to the fish I am already selling. I am planning on doing this because tomato selling and banana selling businesses are lucrative.","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically. Every week whenever she meets her friends in the Organisation B group they discuss issues that help promote prudent financial management.; Money earned from the social cash transfer has eased the pressure on expenditures as there is a guaranteed fixed amount of income each month paid to the respondent. The money realised from the business also helps  to increase the buying power of the household members. New assets have been bought like a radio and a memory card which provides entertainment to the household besides being a source of information.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>"],"color":["#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488"],"hashtags":["; NA","NA; ","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA; ","NA","NA","NA"],"width":[1.68023255813953,10,1.2093023255814,1.15697674418605,1.1046511627907,2.77906976744186,5.3953488372093,1.47093023255814,1.36627906976744,1.31395348837209],"label":["13","172","4","3","2","34","84","9","7","6"],"link_memo":["","","","","","","","","",""],"smooth.roundness":[0,0,0,0,0.184304508476215,0.200349767061997,0,0,0,0],"smooth.enabled":[false,false,false,false,true,true,false,false,false,false],"smooth.type":["diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross"],"link_id":["30; 157; 186; 287; 404; 457; 461; 542; 547; 834; 908; 968; 1056","9; 13; 20; 24; 87; 92; 97; 107; 113; 126; 129; 145; 158; 164; 170; 174; 176; 187; 192; 193; 197; 199; 201; 221; 225; 228; 230; 232; 235; 238; 244; 246; 257; 260; 263; 266; 272; 275; 278; 283; 288; 293; 296; 301; 303; 308; 314; 324; 328; 330; 334; 338; 341; 351; 356; 363; 367; 370; 375; 385; 389; 398; 405; 412; 415; 419; 423; 428; 430; 453; 462; 472; 474; 476; 481; 503; 509; 517; 543; 548; 554; 567; 572; 577; 590; 594; 597; 602; 606; 608; 617; 620; 642; 647; 650; 656; 660; 665; 668; 670; 682; 690; 694; 698; 707; 709; 718; 723; 776; 780; 785; 790; 791; 794; 796; 804; 806; 813; 819; 823; 829; 835; 838; 842; 848; 853; 856; 862; 870; 871; 875; 881; 885; 888; 892; 895; 909; 914; 917; 920; 927; 934; 936; 941; 950; 962; 969; 972; 975; 981; 988; 993; 1000; 1008; 1014; 1022; 1025; 1043; 1047; 1057; 1067; 1071; 1091; 1095; 1099; 1110; 1118; 1127; 1131; 1142; 1158; 1162","56; 66; 515; 611","57; 797; 910","36; 710","11; 17; 162; 188; 223; 237; 358; 408; 425; 455; 469; 546; 649; 691; 696; 725; 788; 795; 809; 824; 837; 844; 864; 878; 897; 912; 916; 942; 970; 990; 1001; 1018; 1094; 1129","25; 95; 100; 130; 165; 175; 177; 189; 194; 226; 231; 239; 247; 258; 261; 264; 273; 279; 291; 294; 309; 316; 329; 339; 343; 349; 352; 359; 364; 368; 381; 386; 390; 393; 409; 413; 426; 431; 437; 466; 473; 477; 505; 551; 556; 573; 595; 598; 609; 615; 618; 621; 651; 661; 700; 708; 721; 777; 792; 815; 820; 825; 839; 854; 857; 865; 893; 898; 918; 922; 937; 943; 952; 973; 991; 1023; 1044; 1061; 1083; 1097; 1112; 1124; 1132; 1159","133; 655; 693; 714; 801; 883; 1039; 1054; 1135","59; 103; 109; 327; 471; 818; 1032","167; 749; 750; 762; 767; 1136"],"title":["<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-7; mkf-11; mjf-12; mkf-3; mkf-6; ncm-19; nbm-21; nbf-15; nbf-17; nbm-18;\nmjm-4<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:10; 100; 124; 182; 248; 275; 277; 322; 324; 469; 517; 541; 579<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:; NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:f3_what is the main reason for this change?; d1_please tell me about the other\nthings your household does to earn money, food and to get other things?

They no longer gather wild foods during the hungry months because the available cash is used to purchase food from the market. The social cash transfer program has brought about this change. Before this program sometimes the family would not afford three meals a day but now they are able to have three meals which include breakfast, lunch and supper.; There is more peace in the family now than before. Children are happy because they are able have regular meals.  In terms of decision making, she is the one who makes major financial decisions at the household. Household responsibilities are shared among the members notwithstanding their gender. Organisation X promotes gender equality and therefore beneficiaries have embraced the concept of sharing roles and responsibilities equally at the household.; She has enough food for household and her business is thriving since October 20xx. Overall, she is a happier person compared to previous years. Increased assets she has acquired is testimony of her improved wellbeing.; The relationship has improved over the past months because the children from this household are no longer food beggars in the community which was something that strained the relationship between parents. On the other hand, she claimed that her economic improvement has attracted some jealousy from people who do not wish her well. She is not allowed to benefit from other programs that offer financial assistance like the Organisation C Program in which people work on a community project and get paid. She is denied on account that she already benefiiting from the program implemented by Organisation X. \"You cannot have everything for yourself. Everybody needs money and you have to give a chance to other people to also benefit from other programs as you enjoy assistance from Organisation X\".","This beneficiary is also a member of a local Organisation B group where she saves her money. Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer program is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed under the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if saving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her income anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months she has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes, charcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She borrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back with an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that through this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.; I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?; I have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I get Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money to start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in the Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my money accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from Organisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the fish selling  business I am operating. My future plans are to expand my business by also selling tomatoes and bananas in addition to the fish I am already selling. I am planning on doing this because tomato selling and banana selling businesses are lucrative.","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically. Every week whenever she meets her friends in the Organisation B group they discuss issues that help promote prudent financial management.; Money earned from the social cash transfer has eased the pressure on expenditures as there is a guaranteed fixed amount of income each month paid to the respondent.

The social cash transfer\nprogram has brought about this change. Before this program sometimes the\nfamily would not afford three meals a day but now they are able to have three\nmeals which include breakfast, lunch and supper.<\/br> There is more peace\nin the family now than before. Children are happy because they are able have\nregular meals. In terms of decision making, she is the one who makes major\nfinancial decisions at the household. Household responsibilities are shared\namong the members notwithstanding their gender. Organisation X promotes gender\nequality and therefore beneficiaries have embraced the concept of sharing roles\nand responsibilities equally at the household.<\/br> She has enough food for\nhousehold and her business is thriving since October 20xx. Overall, she is a\nhappier person compared to previous years. Increased assets she has acquired\nis testimony of her improved wellbeing.<\/br> The relationship has improved over\nthe past months because the children from this household are no longer food\nbeggars in the community which was something that strained the relationship\nbetween parents. On the other hand, she claimed that her economic improvement\nhas attracted some jealousy from people who do not wish her well. She is not\nallowed to benefit from other programs that offer financial assistance like\nthe Organisation C Program in which people work on a community project and get\npaid. She is denied on account that she already benefiiting from the program\nimplemented by Organisation X. \"You cannot have everything for yourself.\nEverybody needs money and you have to give a chance to other people to also\nbenefit from other programs as you enjoy assistance from Organisation X\".<\/p>","<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mkf-8; nbf-14; nbf-17<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:33; 449; 517<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:f1_please tell me about how your household spends and saves money? has it\nchanged in the last year?; d1_please tell me about the other things your\nhousehold does to earn money, food and to get other things? how has this changed\nover the last year?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>This beneficiary is also a member of a local Organisation B group where she\nsaves her money. Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer\nprogram is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed\nunder the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if\nsaving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her\nincome anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months\nshe has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes,\ncharcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She\nborrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back\nwith an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that\nthrough this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.<\/\nbr> I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money\nI get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items\nwhich were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is\nmy husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning\nmore than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how\nmoney is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X.\nWith regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly\nvisible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which\nwas not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly\non saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X\nand instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some\nof it at the Organisation B group. So far, I can easily borrow money from the\nOrganisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group,\nI could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not\ntrust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for ganyus to\nsolve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I\njust bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation\nX. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so\nthat I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my\ncommunity making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?<\/br>\nI have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I\nget Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money\nto start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in\nthe Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my\nmoney accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from\nOrganisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the\nfish selling business I am operating. My future plans are to expand my business\nby also selling tomatoes and bananas in addition to the fish I am already\nselling. I am planning on doing this because tomato selling and banana selling\nbusinesses are lucrative.<\/p>","<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-7; nbm-24<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:11; 401<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:f5_what is the main reason for this change?; f3_what is the main reason for this\nchange?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a\nbusiness for income generation has helped to empower her economically.

They no longer gather wild foods during the hungry months because the available cash is used to purchase food from the market. The social cash transfer program has brought about this change. Before this program sometimes the family would not afford three meals a day but now they are able to have three meals which include breakfast, lunch and supper.; There is more peace in the family now than before. Children are happy because they are able have regular meals.  In terms of decision making, she is the one who makes major financial decisions at the household. Household responsibilities are shared among the members notwithstanding their gender. Organisation X promotes gender equality and therefore beneficiaries have embraced the concept of sharing roles and responsibilities equally at the household.; She has enough food for household and her business is thriving since October 20xx. Overall, she is a happier person compared to previous years. Increased assets she has acquired is testimony of her improved wellbeing.; The relationship has improved over the past months because the children from this household are no longer food beggars in the community which was something that strained the relationship between parents. On the other hand, she claimed that her economic improvement has attracted some jealousy from people who do not wish her well. She is not allowed to benefit from other programs that offer financial assistance like the Organisation C Program in which people work on a community project and get paid. She is denied on account that she already benefiiting from the program implemented by Organisation X. \"You cannot have everything for yourself. Everybody needs money and you have to give a chance to other people to also benefit from other programs as you enjoy assistance from Organisation X\".","This beneficiary is also a member of a local Organisation B group where she saves her money. Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer program is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed under the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if saving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her income anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months she has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes, charcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She borrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back with an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that through this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.; I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?; I have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I get Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money to start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in the Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my money accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from Organisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the fish selling  business I am operating. My future plans are to expand my business by also selling tomatoes and bananas in addition to the fish I am already selling. I am planning on doing this because tomato selling and banana selling businesses are lucrative.","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically. Every week whenever she meets her friends in the Organisation B group they discuss issues that help promote prudent financial management.; Money earned from the social cash transfer has eased the pressure on expenditures as there is a guaranteed fixed amount of income each month paid to the respondent. The money realised from the business also helps  to increase the buying power of the household members. New assets have been bought like a radio and a memory card which provides entertainment to the household besides being a source of information.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>"],"color":["#F9E6B4","#5F187F","#FCF9BD","#FCFBBE","#FCFDBF","#F2BBA0","#D54B71","#FAEFB8","#FBF3BA","#FBF5BB"],"hashtags":["; NA","NA; ","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA; ","NA","NA","NA"],"width":[1.68023255813953,10,1.2093023255814,1.15697674418605,1.1046511627907,2.77906976744186,5.3953488372093,1.47093023255814,1.36627906976744,1.31395348837209],"label":["13","172","4","3","2","34","84","9","7","6"],"link_memo":["","","","","","","","","",""],"smooth.roundness":[0,0,0,0,-0.206050936347538,0.0511994522925138,0,0,0,0],"smooth.enabled":[false,false,false,false,true,true,false,false,false,false],"smooth.type":["diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross","diagonalCross"],"link_id":["30; 157; 186; 287; 404; 457; 461; 542; 547; 834; 908; 968; 1056","9; 13; 20; 24; 87; 92; 97; 107; 113; 126; 129; 145; 158; 164; 170; 174; 176; 187; 192; 193; 197; 199; 201; 221; 225; 228; 230; 232; 235; 238; 244; 246; 257; 260; 263; 266; 272; 275; 278; 283; 288; 293; 296; 301; 303; 308; 314; 324; 328; 330; 334; 338; 341; 351; 356; 363; 367; 370; 375; 385; 389; 398; 405; 412; 415; 419; 423; 428; 430; 453; 462; 472; 474; 476; 481; 503; 509; 517; 543; 548; 554; 567; 572; 577; 590; 594; 597; 602; 606; 608; 617; 620; 642; 647; 650; 656; 660; 665; 668; 670; 682; 690; 694; 698; 707; 709; 718; 723; 776; 780; 785; 790; 791; 794; 796; 804; 806; 813; 819; 823; 829; 835; 838; 842; 848; 853; 856; 862; 870; 871; 875; 881; 885; 888; 892; 895; 909; 914; 917; 920; 927; 934; 936; 941; 950; 962; 969; 972; 975; 981; 988; 993; 1000; 1008; 1014; 1022; 1025; 1043; 1047; 1057; 1067; 1071; 1091; 1095; 1099; 1110; 1118; 1127; 1131; 1142; 1158; 1162","56; 66; 515; 611","57; 797; 910","36; 710","11; 17; 162; 188; 223; 237; 358; 408; 425; 455; 469; 546; 649; 691; 696; 725; 788; 795; 809; 824; 837; 844; 864; 878; 897; 912; 916; 942; 970; 990; 1001; 1018; 1094; 1129","25; 95; 100; 130; 165; 175; 177; 189; 194; 226; 231; 239; 247; 258; 261; 264; 273; 279; 291; 294; 309; 316; 329; 339; 343; 349; 352; 359; 364; 368; 381; 386; 390; 393; 409; 413; 426; 431; 437; 466; 473; 477; 505; 551; 556; 573; 595; 598; 609; 615; 618; 621; 651; 661; 700; 708; 721; 777; 792; 815; 820; 825; 839; 854; 857; 865; 893; 898; 918; 922; 937; 943; 952; 973; 991; 1023; 1044; 1061; 1083; 1097; 1112; 1124; 1132; 1159","133; 655; 693; 714; 801; 883; 1039; 1054; 1135","59; 103; 109; 327; 471; 818; 1032","167; 749; 750; 762; 767; 1136"],"title":["<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-7; mkf-11; mjf-12; mkf-3; mkf-6; ncm-19; nbm-21; nbf-15; nbf-17; nbm-18;\nmjm-4<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:10; 100; 124; 182; 248; 275; 277; 322; 324; 469; 517; 541; 579<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:; NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:f3_what is the main reason for this change?; d1_please tell me about the other\nthings your household does to earn money, food and to get other things?

Before Organisation X introduced their interventions, the family used to access information regarding sanitation and hygiene from the Health Surveillance Assistant who is a government agent whose job is to promote public health awareness in the community among other duties.

In the main garden he has grown  maize, sorghum, sweet potatoes and pearl millet (mchewere). Unlike the previous years, the respondent said that he applied compost manure to his crops. He also used conservation agricultural methods which lesrned from Organisation X extension officers. He grew more maize than any other crop because they consume it more than any food. This year's yield has been affected by the outbreak of fall worms but will still be better that what he produced last year on the same piece of land. Sorghum is mostly grown upland but most often it does not do well because of the drought as well as floods that are caused by runoff water from the mountains. Because of this setback he grows less of this crop. The family has no livestock at the moment but intends to buy a goat in the near future as part of income diversification strategy. To ensure food security the respindent said that he also plans to to embark on winter cropping along the irrigable land along the river. He has already been given sweet potato cuttings by Organisation X for the same purpose. The respondent revealed that this growing season he has reduced the time for doing piece work because he is able to earn money monthly. Consequently he has more time now to produce his own food crops for the betterment of his family.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","I grow mazie always so there is no change with regards to crops grown. However, the only change is that I have planted hybrid maize this 20xx/18 agricultural season as per the advice from the field worker from Organisation X. So I can forsee a bigger harvest than the years before. I have bought a goat from combined Organisation X money and social cash transfer money in October 20xx. I bought that goat to sell when it multiplies so that I can still survive even after these organizations stop helping us. Overall, the time spent on farm production has increased because with hybrid maize, extra care is needed to ensure a good harvest. I am planning on growing more maize in future to sell so that I can take care of my family.; Important link to  - Agric. Extension service: Grown hybrid for the first time and yields seem to be more than before; The household now plants early maturing varieties of maize to mitigate the impact of climate change which among other things results into inadequte rainfall in the area. Local varieties of maize were mostly late maturing and this was unsustainable because the rains stopped before the crops had matured and the family frequently faced food shortages. The family has also adopted the cultivation of other crops like potatoes, sorghum and beans just to make sure the household is food secure even if one crop fails to do well. The respondent said that they grow more maize and less sorghum. Growing many types fo crops has a cost of its own. The extra crops require extra gardens. The family does not own enough land. They rent extra land at K5,000 per growing season which they cannot easily afford as they have other critically important issues that need money. Over the past years the time spent on farmimg activities has reduced mainly because of the drought. Some crops failed to germinate and some gardens were bandoned hence reduction on labour demand for farming. Organizations like Organisation X are ewncouraging people like him to practice winter cropping to make up for the loss of yields due to droughts.; Important link to  - provide agriculture expertise: more yield for improved food security; The respondent was taught modern farming methods like \"Technique1\" which is a conservation agriculture technique. With this type of farming method, a small piece of land produces high yields compared to ordinary farming methods which the respondent has been using over the past years. Organisation X trained her and other beneficiaries on the use of modern farming methods to improve food security. This growing season she planted sorghum, maize, pearl millet (mchewere), groundnuts and sweet potatoes. Maize has not done well because of the fall army worms which damaged the crops in the field. She grew more maize because it is a staple food and grew less groundnuts due to shortage of farmimg land. All the crops are grown primarily for household consumption. Being an old lady, she says she is not very productive nowadays as her body is becomimg frail. The labour demand compels her to only cultivate a sizeable garden which she can manage to work on. Organisation X provided her with sweet potato stem cuttings so that she can plant in the swampy areas when the rains are over in order to be food secure.","The respondent said that in addition to the normal farming, she has a kitchen garden where the family grows vegetables for consumption in order to improve nutrition in the household. This is something new and she learnt this from Organisation X field officers. She has also learned mixed cropping using modern farming methods like conservation agriculture which does not use the traditional ridges. Farmers use maize stalks for mulching in order to conserve moisture, avoid erosion and improve soil fertility. For the first time she planted hybrid maize seeds for the first time because she was able to purchase using part of her cash handouts she receives from Organisation X. She was advised by Organisation X extension officers to plant one seed per hole at 25cm apart and this system of planting maize is called Technique3. The crops are mainly grown for home consumption. She has also purchased a goat for the first time using the same source of income. Going foward she wants to expand crop production by acquiring more farming land through land rentals. This farming season, the respondent said she had no time for piece work unlike the previous years because she could afford to buy food using part of the cash handouts she gets monthly from Organisation X.; We have been taught by Organisation X to plant kitchen gardens so that we eat balanced meals and sell some of the crops.","I grow mazie always so there is no change with regards to crops grown.

I am planning on growing more maize in future to sell so that I can take care of my family.; With regards to farm production, I have implemented new farming techniques because of Organisation X; for instance I have adopted Mtayakhasu (zero tillage) this year in order to have more yields. Regarding new crops I have grown this season, for the first time, I have grown groundnuts which were made available at our market by Organisation X. I have grown groundnuts because they fetch alot of money once sold and they are nutritious. I have also grown sugarcane this season for the purpose of selling them to earn extra income based on the advice by Organisation X that we have to be self-dependent. In the case of livestock, I have bought 3 chickens this year in February so that I sell them when they multiply. I used the part of the money I receive per month from Organisation X to buy these chickens. Overall, the time I spend with farm production has increased because I am no longer doing ganyu. The advice on good agricultural practices from Organisation X has also meant that I spend more time with farm production than before where I would pay little attention to my crops and I would not follow proper procedures in farming. In future, I would want to get a tradle pump or engine pump to engage in irrigation farming and grow onions and tomatoes which fetch alot of money here.; In the future, we would want to grow more beans and soya and find a good market for these crops because we make losses when we sell to vendors.; As regards to plans (future), people want to grow irish potatoes because they do not require alot of water, they are high yielding and fetch alot of money on the market. We are also planning on doing irrigation farming due to the dry spells we face and we would want to grow tomatoes, beans, onions and peas because they fetch alot of money on the market.","Let me not lie to you, the major source of money for me is the cash transfers I get from Organisation X. With my physical disability, I cannot carry tomatoes on my head to sell at the market because I crawl and cannot stand up straight. This money from Organisation X has been used to build my house and I am still saving some of that money for ironsheets. Before Organisation X, I was completely helpless. I had nowhere to run to because with my physical condition, it is not possible for me to do ganyu in the farms of other people. This month, I have started selling beer and it is easier for me because I do not have to move alot and I sell here at my house. The money I have used to start up this business is from Organisation X. I can say that I have engaged more in income generating activities than before because of this cash transfers from Organisation X. I have started up the beer-selling business because I want to buy the ironsheets for the house I build last year. I have bought 2 ducks and a chicken using the cash transfers from Organisation X for the purpose of selling these when they multiply.","Things are better relationship-wise because people in the community know that I have food and money so they want to associate with me now more than before Organisation X because maybe they would want me to help them with the money I get from Organisation X.  There are no changes in the way people work together in the village.; Important link to Organisation X - Cash Transfer: Sterted banana selling business, improved nutrition at household level and improved relationships with others in the community.","This farming season the family adopted conservation agriculture farming methods which improve moisture retention in view of the erratic rainfall. This technique is being promoted by Organisation X field officers in the area. She grows more maize than sorghum because sorghum is grown upland which is not fertile enough while maize is growing along the river banks after the rains which are more fertile. Last growing season she did not produce enough because she spent most of her time caring for a sick relative during the planting season. Since she became a beneficiary of Organisation X, she has reduced her time doing piece work. Therefore she is able to dedicate more time to her own projects. Using part of the money she receives from Organisation X every month, she has manageed to buy chickens which she is rearing now will be selling in the future to absorb the unforeseeable shocks.

When she gets the government cash handout she shares it with other people who are not official beneficiaries in accordance with the agreement she made with the village headman during the beneficiary selection process.  Furthermore the fritters business which has been started out of the proceeds from Organisation X also gives her an extra income.; The family eats meal more than any other type of food.

They no longer gather wild foods during the hungry months because the available cash is used to purchase food from the market. The social cash transfer program has brought about this change. Before this program sometimes the family would not afford three meals a day but now they are able to have three meals which include breakfast, lunch and supper.; There is more peace in the family now than before. Children are happy because they are able have regular meals.  In terms of decision making, she is the one who makes major financial decisions at the household. Household responsibilities are shared among the members notwithstanding their gender. Organisation X promotes gender equality and therefore beneficiaries have embraced the concept of sharing roles and responsibilities equally at the household.; She has enough food for household and her business is thriving since October 20xx. Overall, she is a happier person compared to previous years. Increased assets she has acquired is testimony of her improved wellbeing.; The relationship has improved over the past months because the children from this household are no longer food beggars in the community which was something that strained the relationship between parents. On the other hand, she claimed that her economic improvement has attracted some jealousy from people who do not wish her well. She is not allowed to benefit from other programs that offer financial assistance like the Organisation C Program in which people work on a community project and get paid. She is denied on account that she already benefiiting from the program implemented by Organisation X. \"You cannot have everything for yourself.

Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer program is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed under the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if saving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her income anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months she has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes, charcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She borrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back with an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that through this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.; I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?; I have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I get Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money to start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in the Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my money accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from Organisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the fish selling  business I am operating. My future plans are to expand my business by also selling tomatoes and bananas in addition to the fish I am already selling. I am planning on doing this because tomato selling and banana selling businesses are lucrative.","She has been able to buy a goat, household utensils, blankets, chickens, 3 iron sheets and other things. These are things she has just managed to buy since becoming a beneficiary of the social cash transfer implemented by Organisation X in 20xx.; Money received from the social cash transfer program every month is the main reason for this increased amount of household assets she has just bought recently.","The relationship has been enhanced because of these interventions. She is able to pay school fees for her children without falling into debts. She has more peace of mind now than before. The family members are also able to share household chores not based on traditional gender norms as was the case in the previous years. Organisation X has taught the beneficiaries to share responsibilities equally at household level regardless of gender. Her husband now assists in taking care of the little kid they have in terms of feeding and bathing. In the past kitchen work was for women only but with the trainings and awareness campaigns being conducted by Organisation X people are embracing the new gender concepts and  changing their mindset.","The respondent said that during this past growing season he was able to dedicate more time to his farm work more than the previous years. Organisation X pays him K15,000 monthly. Part of this money was used to purchase hybrid maize seeds which are not only high yielding but also early maturing. Perviously he used to grow some local maize varieties because he could not afford to buy hybrid seeds on the market. Local varieties were mostly late maturing and low yielding and not suitable for an area which frequently faces unreliable rains. This year he grew maize, sorghum and sugarcanes. Sugarcane is the newest crop to be cultivated as a cash crop upon advice from Organisation X. He has cultivated it for the very first time.  He has grown more maize than sorghum this year because of late the latter has not been doing well up field because of drought.

I would in this case work in the garden alone but now things have changed as I have pointed out. With regards to how dcisions are made over food and money, I am a widow so I make decisions alone now since my husband died in July 20xx. Regarding shocks, I have more confidence and peace now because I borrow from the Organisation B group whenever I am faced with an emergency.

Before last year, I was only planting local maize variety which would give me 10 bags of 50kgs but with the hybrid maize, I have harvetsed 18 bags of 50kg. With regards to livestock, thieves stole my 3 goats and ducks which I bought last year for the purpose of selling them when they multiply so that I use the money earned to build my dream home. At the moment I am not keeping any livestock. Over the last year, I have dedicated more time on farm production because I have the money from the Organisation X Organisation B and seed from the same NGO which was not the case before. I could not cultivate every garden I had because I could barely afford the inputs. But that has all changed, I can afford to cultivate all my gardens but I deliberately leave some uncultivated because I want to rent them out to others to earn extra money. I can afford to buy farm inputs because of the money I receive from Organisation X. In future, I would want to buy cattle and goats so that I sell them and use the money to build my dream house which would be bigger than the one I am living in now. The plot where the house would be built would be big enough to even allow my children to build their own houses there as well.; I used to do ganyu in other people's farms in the years before I started benefiting from Organisation X. Now I no longer see the need to do ganyu because I have the money which I receive every month from Organisation X to meet my needs. I have even invested some of that money into buying bananas which I sell. I chose to invest some of this money into the banana selling business because bananas are expensive here and therefore fetch alot of money on the market when sold. I am planning on buying goats in the future so that I can sell them when they multiply.Overall, the time I spend on income generation has increased because I am busy selling bananas everyday unlike before when I used to do ganyu because it was not everyday that I would have ganyu work. I see people in my community who are able to build houses and live comfortably because they sell goats so I would ike to do the same.","For the first time in my life, I have bought hybrid maize seed and planted it in my garden last year. Previously, I used to plant local maize seed because it was readily available, and cheap. I have been able to switch to hybrid seed because there were lead farmers from Organisation X that taught us good agricultural practices and brought the hybrid seed closer to us at the market which was not the case before because the hybrid seed was only available at the boma in Nsanje. The lead farmers encouraged us to use hybrid seed because it produced more yields when compared against local maize seed varieties. I managed to buy this seed because of the money I received from Organisation X I should not lie to you. As you can see me, I cannot afford such seed on my own without assistance. Regarding livestock, I have bought chickens in the past 4 months using the money I got from Organisation X so that I sell them when they multiply. I would want to use the money from selling chickens to feed my children. i bought chickens because they are cheaper than goats yet one is able to make ends meet by selling them. I started receiving money from Organisation X in October and I get MK15000 per month. There are no changes on time spent on farm production as far as me and my household are Organisation Xed. My plans for the future are that I would want to buy a plot to cultivate more maize which I would sell and use the money to buy ironsheets for my house. Maize fetches alot of money here because it is a commodity that quickly becomes scarce once harvested due to the dry spells that we face every year.","She earns money every month from Organisation X as well as from government through the social cash transfer programs.

The plot where the house would be built would be big enough to even allow my children to build their own houses there as well.","For a long time I have been relying on selling farm produce like maize as a source of income. However, with Organisation X, I have also been selling sweetpotatoes because the organisation gave us some seedlings. In the years before last year, I would only sell maize but now I can also sell sweetpotatoes in addition to the maize. Most importantly, I have joined the Organisation B group in my village which is managed by Organisation X again. This has made a very big difference in my savings because before joining this Organisation B, I would rely on getting loans from my friends whenever I was facing an emergency. Accessing help from my friends was not guaranteed because some of my friends would tell me that they did not have the kind of money I needed.  Before last year, I used to drink alot such that I was not able to save any money. When I made my decision to quit drinking last year, I thought I would save the money I was using for drinking into a Organisation B group and use the money for worthwhile causes. What motivated me to join this Organisation B was the fact that I always saw my friends engaging in businesses and taking care of their families whilst I was unable to do so because I did not know how to save money. In the future, I would want to grow alot of beans so that I can earn more money than I am now because beans in this community fetch more money than any other crops including sweetpotatoes. For the sweetpotato, it is the seedlings that fetch more money on the market than the potatoes themselves. In this case I am also planning to sell sweetpotato seedlings.; As a household head and breadwinner, I used to spend more on beer in the period before last year. However, that has changed since I quit drinking last year and joined the Organisation B. I use the money for building my house which was not the case before. I can buy shoes for my children such that they no longer walk barefooted to school as was the case before I joined the Organisation B group. When I was drinking, those I was drinking with would dictate how I should spend my money but ever since I quit and joined the Organisation B, i am soley responsible for every decision that is made on spending in the household. I decided to quit drinking and join the Organisation B group because I was reflecting on how my peers were doing better than I was because they were saving money. The money we have as a family is saved in the Organisation B because it accumulates interest which can be used to buy household necessities including food as well as shelter by building a house which I am doing at the moment. Apart from myself, my wife and all my children are in Organisation B groups but they are not operated by NGOs. These are groups that are just created by people in the community. They have joined these community Organisation Bs in January and are yet to share out the money. My expectation is that the economic burden of meeting all their needs on an individual basis will be lessened. By joining the Organisation B group, I no longer have the need to borrow from my friends and no longer have the need to have debts because the money I get from the Organisation B caters for the many things that are needed in my household. I have not bought or sold any assets but I am planning on buying goats to replace those that were stolen last December. I would want to be rearing them and sell them when they multiply so that I can live a comfortable life and build my dream house.","Relationships have improved because with the coming of NGOs like Organisation X, we are able to work together in the community. Last September, we even planted trees together something which was not possible without the presence of NGOs.","Since 20xx, we have had NGOs like Organisation K Organisation L project and Organisation X teaching people on how to have good nutrition and people have been following this advice to stay healthy and there are improvements so far. Before these NGOs, we would just eat whatever food that was available but now we try to have balanced meals such that we are stronger and healthier than before.; Important link to USD (Organisation L) - Health and sanitation: reduced stunting; People in this community have started eating balanced meals to prevent illnesses caused by poor nutrition as advised by the HSAs.","Organisation H1 also gave money to people so that they buy food and they started in December 20xx by giving households MK13,000.; NGOs are also giving people money like GOAL and Organisation X; as a result there are fewer people doing ganyus and more people doing small scale businesses because the money from the organizations is used as capital for their businesses.; People normally eat Meal with vegetables, beans and fish and also have porridge mixed with moringa herb or sugar for breakfast. Previously, we would not have breakfast because we did not have money. At least we are eating better food now because of money from NGOs like GOAL and Organisation X. We are not there yet, it is just better. During the lean season, people used to eat Nyika, but now we eat bananas and sweetpotatoes bought from other people because of the money received from Organisation X and GOAL. Those who eat well are those who benefit from Organisation X and GOAL but the majority are not beneficiaries so it is minimal positive impact.","Dealing with emergencies has changed because the money is now easily borrowed from the Organisation Bs managed by Organisation X and GOAL unlike in the past where we would ask from friends which was not easy.","Important link to Organisation M - food handouts: mitigated impact of hunger","She is a beneficiary of two social cash transfer programs being implemented by Organisation X and the government through the Social Welfare department. Organisation X pays her K15,000 monthly while the government pays her about K19,000 after three months or so of waiting and this figure fluctuates from time to time hence cannot mention exact amount. When she gets the government cash handout she shares it with other people who are not official beneficiaries in accordance with the agreement she made with the village headman during the beneficiary selection process.  Furthermore the fritters business which has been started out of the proceeds from Organisation X also gives her an extra income.","While his family is celebrating the economic transformation and overall unity within the household other members of the community have become jealousy of the success he has achieved and are treating him with disdain. Consequently they are forcing him to pay for rentals on borrowed gardens he used to farm freely when he was a pauper. On the other hand he said he relates very well with NGOs and other authorities within the community.","With the advice on good agricultural practices from Organisation X, I have been  involved more than ever before in farm production such that I even bought fertilizer this season using the money received from Organisation X. Although I am also benefiting from the social cash transfer program from the government, the money does not come on a monthly basis such that I have to borrow from friends in order to survive; when the cash transfer comes in, I use it to repay my loans. But with Organisation X, I have managed to buy fertilizer becasue the money is more than the social cash transfer one and becasue it is given to us every month. All in all, I am expecting more yields this season as a result of the advice from Organisation X.; Important link to Social Cash Transfer - Cash transfer: No change because there is no consistency in their support so I ended up using that money to pay debts.","The family normally grows maize which is their main staple crop. They also grow other crops such as soya beans, groundnuts and sweet potatoes. During the last growing season, the family adopted some new farming methodologies such as conservation agriculture as well as Technique3 type of maize planting (one seed per hole at 25cm apart). They used compost manure this time and they were taught all these by extension workers from Organisation X. She cultivates more maize than any other crop because that is the primary food crop. She  cultivates less sweet potatoes because of shortage of farming land. She has also abandoned the use of local maize varieties because of their little yield and failure to mature in time in the face of erratic rainfall being experienced these days. In the future she plans to grow more beans for commercial purposes in order to generate more income for the family. Organisation X advises them to diversify crops in order to achieve food security at the household level even if one crop fails.","The household now plants early maturing varieties of maize to mitigate the impact of climate change which among other things results into inadequte rainfall in the area. Local varieties of maize were mostly late maturing and this was unsustainable because the rains stopped before the crops had matured and the family frequently faced food shortages. The family has also adopted the cultivation of other crops like potatoes, sorghum and beans just to make sure the household is food secure even if one crop fails to do well. The respondent said that they grow more maize and less sorghum. Growing many types fo crops has a cost of its own. The extra crops require extra gardens. The family does not own enough land. They rent extra land at K5,000 per growing season which they cannot easily afford as they have other critically important issues that need money. Over the past years the time spent on farmimg activities has reduced mainly because of the drought. Some crops failed to germinate and some gardens were bandoned hence reduction on labour demand for farming. Organizations like Organisation X are ewncouraging people like him to practice winter cropping to make up for the loss of yields due to droughts.","I have cultivated Hybrid maize seed since Organisation X came in last year. Before Organisation X came in, I used to plant the local mazie seed variety. When Organisation X came in to work in our village, their field advisers encouraged us to use hybrid maize varieties which are early maturing as well as higher yielding varieties. However, this advice has not produced results because of the dry spells that hit this area. For the livestock, I have bought 2 chickens last year October so that I can sell them when they multiply. I would want to use the money realised from selling the chickens to buying iron sheets for my leaking grass-thatched house. I managed to buy these because of the money I got from Organisation X because in the past I could have hardly managed to do so. With regards to the time spent on farm production, there are no changes. However, i am planing on buying goats in future to sell them when they multiply so that I make ends meet in my home.; Although the field advisers from Organisation X had encouraged us to implement good agricultural practices , because the weather in the district is mostly not conducive for agriculture such that there are frequent dryspells, progress in agricultural activities is hardly realised and such is my story. You plant hybrid maize but still you get nothing at the end of the day because of the weather and rainfall pattern.; There has been low production due to dry spells.; With regards to assets sold, people have sold goats due to economic hardship or even trying to pay school fees. People are selling livestock because they cannot sell much crop due to dry spells so livestock is the second best option to making money.","The respondent said that during this past growing season he was able to dedicate more time to his farm work more than the previous years. Organisation X pays him K15,000 monthly. Part of this money was used to purchase hybrid maize seeds which are not only high yielding but also early maturing. Perviously he used to grow some local maize varieties because he could not afford to buy hybrid seeds on the market. Local varieties were mostly late maturing and low yielding and not suitable for an area which frequently faces unreliable rains. This year he grew maize, sorghum and sugarcanes. Sugarcane is the newest crop to be cultivated as a cash crop upon advice from Organisation X. He has cultivated it for the very first time.  He has grown more maize than sorghum this year because of late the latter has not been doing well up field because of drought. Maize is also grown through irrigation as this makes up for the loss caused by the drought. The respondent has also grown sweet potatoes whose cuttings were supplied by Organisation X to enhace foosd security at household level. The sweet potatoes are being grown along the river banks. Besides crop production, the respondent has bought a chicken for rearing to caution his income. Hr further intends to buy a goat for the same purpose. All these plans have come out of the trainings Organisation X has been offering to all the beneficiaries of their interventions.; The respondent said that this growing season he has opened a kitchen garden at his home for vegetable production which are meant for family consumption. In the main garden he has grown  maize, sorghum, sweet potatoes and pearl millet (mchewere). Unlike the previous years, the respondent said that he applied compost manure to his crops. He also used conservation agricultural methods which lesrned from Organisation X extension officers. He grew more maize than any other crop because they consume it more than any food. This year's yield has been affected by the outbreak of fall worms but will still be better that what he produced last year on the same piece of land. Sorghum is mostly grown upland but most often it does not do well because of the drought as well as floods that are caused by runoff water from the mountains. Because of this setback he grows less of this crop. The family has no livestock at the moment but intends to buy a goat in the near future as part of income diversification strategy. To ensure food security the respindent said that he also plans to to embark on winter cropping along the irrigable land along the river. He has already been given sweet potato cuttings by Organisation X for the same purpose. The respondent revealed that this growing season he has reduced the time for doing piece work because he is able to earn money monthly. Consequently he has more time now to produce his own food crops for the betterment of his family.","My cousin left in October last year to live with my other relatives because of the poor economic situation we were facing. However, there are no cahnges in the health of the household.; The only change in the composition of my household is the leaving of my son for Country A to do ganyu. He left last year October. With regards to the health of my household, there has been an improvement since we started receiving moey from Organisation X last year October. My children used to suffer from malnutrition but now they are strong and healthy because I can afford to provide a balanced diet for them using this MK 15000 i receive per month from Organisation X","I used to sell fritters but I have stopped this January because business was slow. However, the main sources of income that I have are the Social cash transfers and the money that I get per month from Organisation X. I use this money to buy food and also other things that I need in my household. Before Organisation X, I used to do ganyus for a living even though I was receiving the social cash transfer becasue the money was not enough but now I no longer do ganyus because I have enough money from Organisation X. In future, I am planning on starting a rice selling business as well as selling samoosas because these fetch alot of money in this community.","The only change that has happened regarding the composition of my household is the fact that my son left in October to live with my brother because we were having economic problems and my brother decided to take my son to lessen the economic burden in my household. Regarding our health, we are stronger and healthier now because we are eating three times a day as a result of the money we receive from Organisation X.","I joined the Organisation B managed by Organisation A in 20xx-20xx but I did not benefit much because I did not know the advantages of saving using the Organisation B. With this Organisation B, I used the proceeds to buy plastic sheets for roofing my house. It was an emergency and I was assisted greatly. I also keep money in my purse which I carry with me everywhere I go when I am waiting to deposit to the Organisation B. I also loaned MK20,000 in January 20xx from the Organisation X Organisation B becasue now Organisation A pulled out for reasons not known to us. I used this money to pay for farm labour which I would not have managed on my own. With regards to assets sold, I sold soya in May 20xx but it did not fetch much because we sold to vendors since Organisation A failed to fulfil its promise that it was going to buy soya from us. However, I have bought school uniforms for my children as well as clothes, kitchen utensils like buckets, basins as well as pots using this money from Organisation X.; Organisation A promised to buy our soya but they never did so we have sold to vendors at very low prices.","The household now plants early maturing varieties of maize to mitigate the impact of climate change which among other things results into inadequte rainfall in the area.

Nobody is willing to let others use their land for free anymore.","The major change to my household composition is the death of my husband in July 20xx. There is no one who has joined this household since last year. With regards to the health of my family, it is one my sons that became ill due to malnutrition and the HSA advised us on good nutrition strategies and so far we have seen great changes because he is having balanced meals.","Over the past year the respondent lost her husband and she was left with her only son shw still stays with at the moment. The pasing on of her late husband paralysed the household economically as the respondent had to grapple with the sad reality of becoming the new household head and bread winner. In terms of health, the respondent szaid that they have been in good health and none of the two family members has suffered from any chronic illness.","This farming season the family adopted conservation agriculture farming methods which improve moisture retention in view of the erratic rainfall. This technique is being promoted by Organisation X field officers in the area. She grows more maize than sorghum because sorghum is grown upland which is not fertile enough while maize is growing along the river banks after the rains which are more fertile. Last growing season she did not produce enough because she spent most of her time caring for a sick relative during the planting season. Since she became a beneficiary of Organisation X, she has reduced her time doing piece work. Therefore she is able to dedicate more time to her own projects. Using part of the money she receives from Organisation X every month, she has manageed to buy chickens which she is rearing now will be selling in the future to absorb the unforeseeable shocks. However, some people are stealing her chickens and this is a big threat to her vision of self reliance.","The family was joined by his sickly father early last year after he because chronically sick. He has become part of the household since then as he cannot fend for himself anymore due to his incapacitation. He has paralysed legs. Apart from his aged father, the rest of the family members are in good health.","Farm production in my household has improved  because Organisation X has been giving us hybrid maize seed which produces more yield compared to local seed and they have also been giving us sweetpotato seedlings which help us earn extra income after selling the produce. Before last year, I was only planting local maize variety which would give me 10 bags of 50kgs but with the hybrid maize, I have harvetsed 18 bags of 50kg. With regards to livestock, thieves stole my 3 goats and ducks which I bought last year for the purpose of selling them when they multiply so that I use the money earned to build my dream home. At the moment I am not keeping any livestock. Over the last year, I have dedicated more time on farm production because I have the money from the Organisation X Organisation B and seed from the same NGO which was not the case before. I could not cultivate every garden I had because I could barely afford the inputs. But that has all changed, I can afford to cultivate all my gardens but I deliberately leave some uncultivated because I want to rent them out to others to earn extra money.

With this type of farming method, a small piece of land produces high yields compared to ordinary farming methods which the respondent has been using over the past years. Organisation X trained her and other beneficiaries on the use of modern farming methods to improve food security. This growing season she planted sorghum, maize, pearl millet (mchewere), groundnuts and sweet potatoes. Maize has not done well because of the fall army worms which damaged the crops in the field. She grew more maize because it is a staple food and grew less groundnuts due to shortage of farmimg land. All the crops are grown primarily for household consumption. Being an old lady, she says she is not very productive nowadays as her body is becomimg frail. The labour demand compels her to only cultivate a sizeable garden which she can manage to work on.

There is no change in the crops I grow because I have always grown maize and sweetpotatoes. However, there are changes in the livestock I keep because now I bought 2 goats for selling when they multiply. Goats fetch alot of money in this community and this is why I bought them. I used the money I get from Organisation X to buy these goats. I would use the money realised from selling the goats to buy ironsheets for my house. During this agricultural season, I have spent lesser time on farm production becasue my daughter has helped me so much since joining us last year November. Due to my physical disability, I cannot carry tomatoes on my head to sell so I dont have any new plans in terms of generating income based on farm production.; Let me not lie to you, the major source of money for me is the cash transfers I get from Organisation X. With my physical disability, I cannot carry tomatoes on my head to sell at the market because I crawl and cannot stand up straight. This money from Organisation X has been used to build my house and I am still saving some of that money for ironsheets. Before Organisation X, I was completely helpless. I had nowhere to run to because with my physical condition, it is not possible for me to do ganyu in the farms of other people. This month, I have started selling beer and it is easier for me because I do not have to move alot and I sell here at my house. The money I have used to start up this business is from Organisation X. I can say that I have engaged more in income generating activities than before because of this cash transfers from Organisation X.

I am the one who decides what to spend the money on and how it should be spent because my husband died last year July so I am the head of the house now. With regards to saving money, I keep some money in my purse which I carry with me everywhere I go even in the bathroom. I keep this money with me for easy access whenever there arises a need at household level. I also save some of it in the Organisation B so that it accumulates interest. With the Organisation B, I am able to borrow money without difficulty whenever I need to. In the past I would borrow from my friends but it was not easy to be assisted because of lack of trust. Last year, I have managed to buy chickens and guinea fowls although they all died. In addition to this I have also bought 11 ironsheets using the same money I receive from Organisation X because my house leaks when it rains.","People have suffered from poor health because of malnutrition. Eating once a day has made many of us weak. It is the women most affected because they nurse children so there is malnutrition.

She was never taken to the hospital but was given traditional herbs which did not solve the problem.

They wash hands after visiting the toilet using the hand washing facility also known as Mpondagiya. They slash tall grass around the house to prevent mosquito breeding, dry plates on a dish rack, dump refuse in a rubbish pit, etc. This has helped to avoid disease outbreaks at the household.

She  makes and sells fritters. She also benefits from the social cash transfer program being implemented by Organisation X in the area. She became a beneficiary in October 20xx. She gets K15,000 per month and used part of this money to start her fritters business. Apart from the Organisation X social cash transfer program, she is also a beneficiary of another social cash transfer program which started in 20xx and is being implemented by the government through Social Welfare. This income from government is erratic and sometimes beneficiaries can stay for 3 months without payment. But the one from Organisation X is the most guaranteed source of income for the household. Before becoming a Organisation X social cash transfer beneficiary last year, she used to do piece work for survival. She would spend several weeks in Country A to work on the farms so that she could earn money to sustain her family. But nowadays she is also able to earn money through selling tomatoes which she grows in her garden. She stopped doing piece work for a living courtesy of the interventions being implemented by Organisation X. She further disclosed that government cash transfer is shared among several people are identified by the village leadership without the knowledge of the benefactors. The actual beneficiary is just fronted as if all the income is for her/him yet when the money comes other people in the village get a share. In the end the intended purpose of alleviating poverty is defeated because after splitting the cash the beneficiary remains with too little money to make any meaningful impact. Since chiefs are responsible for selection of beneficiaries the system is abused from the beginning.

Regarding new crops I have grown this season, for the first time, I have grown groundnuts which were made available at our market by Organisation X. I have grown groundnuts because they fetch alot of money once sold and they are nutritious. I have also grown sugarcane this season for the purpose of selling them to earn extra income based on the advice by Organisation X that we have to be self-dependent. In the case of livestock, I have bought 3 chickens this year in February so that I sell them when they multiply. I used the part of the money I receive per month from Organisation X to buy these chickens. Overall, the time I spend with farm production has increased because I am no longer doing ganyu. The advice on good agricultural practices from Organisation X has also meant that I spend more time with farm production than before where I would pay little attention to my crops and I would not follow proper procedures in farming. In future, I would want to get a tradle pump or engine pump to engage in irrigation farming and grow onions and tomatoes which fetch alot of money here.","The family normally grows maize which is their main staple crop. They also grow other crops such as soya beans, groundnuts and sweet potatoes. During the last growing season, the family adopted some new farming methodologies such as conservation agriculture as well as Technique3 type of maize planting (one seed per hole at 25cm apart). They used compost manure this time and they were taught all these by extension workers from Organisation X. She cultivates more maize than any other crop because that is the primary food crop. She  cultivates less sweet potatoes because of shortage of farming land. She has also abandoned the use of local maize varieties because of their little yield and failure to mature in time in the face of erratic rainfall being experienced these days. In the future she plans to grow more beans for commercial purposes in order to generate more income for the family. Organisation X advises them to diversify crops in order to achieve food security at the household level even if one crop fails.; The household now plants early maturing varieties of maize to mitigate the impact of climate change which among other things results into inadequte rainfall in the area. Local varieties of maize were mostly late maturing and this was unsustainable because the rains stopped before the crops had matured and the family frequently faced food shortages. The family has also adopted the cultivation of other crops like potatoes, sorghum and beans just to make sure the household is food secure even if one crop fails to do well. The respondent said that they grow more maize and less sorghum. Growing many types fo crops has a cost of its own. The extra crops require extra gardens. The family does not own enough land. They rent extra land at K5,000 per growing season which they cannot easily afford as they have other critically important issues that need money. Over the past years the time spent on farmimg activities has reduced mainly because of the drought. Some crops failed to germinate and some gardens were bandoned hence reduction on labour demand for farming. Organizations like Organisation X are ewncouraging people like him to practice winter cropping to make up for the loss of yields due to droughts.; The respondent said that during this past growing season he was able to dedicate more time to his farm work more than the previous years. Organisation X pays him K15,000 monthly. Part of this money was used to purchase hybrid maize seeds which are not only high yielding but also early maturing. Perviously he used to grow some local maize varieties because he could not afford to buy hybrid seeds on the market. Local varieties were mostly late maturing and low yielding and not suitable for an area which frequently faces unreliable rains. This year he grew maize, sorghum and sugarcanes. Sugarcane is the newest crop to be cultivated as a cash crop upon advice from Organisation X. He has cultivated it for the very first time.  He has grown more maize than sorghum this year because of late the latter has not been doing well up field because of drought. Maize is also grown through irrigation as this makes up for the loss caused by the drought. The respondent has also grown sweet potatoes whose cuttings were supplied by Organisation X to enhace foosd security at household level. The sweet potatoes are being grown along the river banks. Besides crop production, the respondent has bought a chicken for rearing to caution his income. Hr further intends to buy a goat for the same purpose. All these plans have come out of the trainings Organisation X has been offering to all the beneficiaries of their interventions.; The respondent was taught modern farming methods like \"Technique1\" which is a conservation agriculture technique. With this type of farming method, a small piece of land produces high yields compared to ordinary farming methods which the respondent has been using over the past years. Organisation X trained her and other beneficiaries on the use of modern farming methods to improve food security. This growing season she planted sorghum, maize, pearl millet (mchewere), groundnuts and sweet potatoes. Maize has not done well because of the fall army worms which damaged the crops in the field. She grew more maize because it is a staple food and grew less groundnuts due to shortage of farmimg land. All the crops are grown primarily for household consumption. Being an old lady, she says she is not very productive nowadays as her body is becomimg frail. The labour demand compels her to only cultivate a sizeable garden which she can manage to work on. Organisation X provided her with sweet potato stem cuttings so that she can plant in the swampy areas when the rains are over in order to be food secure.; Cassava has been grown for the first time to compliment the food supply at the household.","Adoption of modern farming methods as well as crop diversification resulted into more farming activities being performed last year than before.; Previously, I used to grow groundnuts and soya in addition to maize but they were not doing well due to the weather. However, this 20xx/18 season, I have cultivted in my dimba and I have implemented advice from Organisation X and now I have harvested more maize and sweetpotatoes. There are no changes in livestock kept becasuse I do not keep livestock. Overall, the time I spend on farm production has increased as a result of implementing good agricultural practices as taught by Organisation X. My plans are that I would want to buy goats for rearing and sell them when they multiply so that I can use that money to take care of the needs of my family.","She is able to buy some farm inputs like early maturing hybrid maize seeds for maximum yield production even though there could be erratic rains. The modern farming methods promoted by Organisation X are less less labour intensive and this allows her to grow other crops using time saved.","The main reason for the changes in farming practices during the past growing season has been the adoption of new farming techniques like \"Technique1\" and Technique2 method of planting maize (planting one maize seed per hole unlike 3 seeds per hole which is a traditional way). This has improved production because from the same piece of land the respondent is expecting more yield compared to the previuos years she has been farming.; Important link to Organisation X - Agric. Extension advice: Its also the reason why I have bought fertilizer this season and I am also expecting more yields because of Mtayakhasu; The demonstration plot in the community has meant that I work in both my garden as well as the community garden and we are expecting more yields this season than before as a result of following good agricultural practices taught by Organisation X and the government.","Previously the household mostly survived on proceeds from ganyu labour. She used to got to Country A to work on the farms there for food. She would spend some few days away from the family. But since last year when she became a beneficiary of Organisation X's social cash transfer, she has not gone back to Country A for ganyu labour in order to feed the family. She has mostly relied on the cash handouts to buy food. She has also established a tomato selling business within the past few months to compliment the household income. Using proceeds from the cash handouts. the husband wants to start a fish selling business in the near future. The income from the sweet potato sells will also be channeled towards the establishment of new businesses and acquisition of assets.","I have utilized advice from Organisation X extension workers on good agricultural practices like planting a seed per station and zero tillage in addition to the correct fertilizer application such that my harverst is bigger than the previous years.; Important link to  - Agric extension advice: Increased yield","Previously, I used to grow groundnuts and soya in addition to maize but they were not doing well due to the weather.

My plans are that I would want to buy goats for rearing and sell them when they multiply so that I can use that money to take care of the needs of my family.; I grow mazie always so there is no change with regards to crops grown. However, the only change is that I have planted hybrid maize this 20xx/18 agricultural season as per the advice from the field worker from Organisation X. So I can forsee a bigger harvest than the years before. I have bought a goat from combined Organisation X money and social cash transfer money in October 20xx. I bought that goat to sell when it multiplies so that I can still survive even after these organizations stop helping us. Overall, the time spent on farm production has increased because with hybrid maize, extra care is needed to ensure a good harvest. I am planning on growing more maize in future to sell so that I can take care of my family.","I have embarked on a small business whereby I sell doughnuts in order to earn money, buy food and get other things. I got the capital for starting this business from the money I get per month from Organisation X. I am focusing more on my business than doing ganyus in the field to supplement my income. I no longer see the need for doing ganyus because I have the money I need to take care of my family and start up a small business. My plans for the future are that I would want to expand my business by selling beans which earn alot more than doughnuts. I would want to use the money realised from selling the beans to buy ironsheets for my house. I have always wanted to live in a house with ironsheets and that is my goal so far.; At present, we are doing businesses like selling tomatoes, cooking oil, sweetpotatoes and friters based on the advice from  Organisation X that we should invest our money in businesses so that we are financially independent. Most of us have stopped doing ganyu because we are busy running our businesses as taught by Organisation X.; Before embarking on such businesses which have stemmed from Organisation X's interventions, these men used to do a lot of ganyu labour including making grass thatched fetches for houses, working in farms and other types of ganyu.; NGOs are also giving people money like GOAL and Organisation X; as a result there are fewer people doing ganyus and more people doing small scale businesses because the money from the organizations is used as capital for their businesses.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically. Every week whenever she meets her friends in the Organisation B group they discuss issues that help promote prudent financial management.; Money earned from the social cash transfer has eased the pressure on expenditures as there is a guaranteed fixed amount of income each month paid to the respondent. The money realised from the business also helps  to increase the buying power of the household members. New assets have been bought like a radio and a memory card which provides entertainment to the household besides being a source of information.","It has improved because the husband and wife both spend more time at home together unlike in the past when either of them would go to Country A for days or weeks fetching ganyu labour. Now there is more shared responsibility between parents. They both equally look after the children the same way. The business ideas are shared as well and the husband also intends to start a fish selling business out of the income generated by the wife. This has improved the bond between them.; There has been a change in the way decisions are made over food and money. I am the one in charge of this because I am the one earning more money at the household.

The fall worms attack crops with more intensity when there is a dry spell. \"When there is a drought the fall worms damage the maize crops a lot unlike when there is incessant rainfall. Despite these challenges, the participants pointed out that farm production has been good in general because they were taught good agricultural practices by Organisation X.","Organisation X has taught us to use hybrid maize and even cultivate a variety of crops including sweetpotatoes, beans, soya as well as groundnuts.","The family is now able to buy food in times of need because they can now afford to do so using the money earned. The income he recieves cautions him against shocks like food shortages and natural disasters. The winter cropping championed by NGOs like Organisation X World Wide has ensured that they produce extra food like sweet potatoes after the rainy season.; Good rainfall and absence of natural disasters was the major reason for a better crop output in the field. Besides that, she also said that NGOs working in the area like Organisation E and Organisation X World Wide have been in the forefront advocating for the adoption of modern farming techniques in order to mitigate the impact of climate change which also affect agriculture production. \"We practice mixed cropping and after the rainy season we are encouraged to embark on irrigation farming. They sometimes give us early maturing varieties of maize and sweet potatoes. This made a difference by far\". Among other crops she grows gonkho (sorghum), pearl millet (mchewere), manduyi (groundnuts), chimbamba (beans) and rice. Apart from chickens she also rears ducks. All these compliment each other in terms of sustaining the household's income.Expert extension advice from NGOs regarding crop diversification motivated her to expand her agricultural enterprise.

Before Organisation X came in, I used to plant the local mazie seed variety. When Organisation X came in to work in our village, their field advisers encouraged us to use hybrid maize varieties which are early maturing as well as higher yielding varieties. However, this advice has not produced results because of the dry spells that hit this area. For the livestock, I have bought 2 chickens last year October so that I can sell them when they multiply. I would want to use the money realised from selling the chickens to buying iron sheets for my leaking grass-thatched house. I managed to buy these because of the money I got from Organisation X because in the past I could have hardly managed to do so. With regards to the time spent on farm production, there are no changes. However, i am planing on buying goats in future to sell them when they multiply so that I make ends meet in my home.; For the first time in my life, I have bought hybrid maize seed and planted it in my garden last year. Previously, I used to plant local maize seed because it was readily available, and cheap. I have been able to switch to hybrid seed because there were lead farmers from Organisation X that taught us good agricultural practices and brought the hybrid seed closer to us at the market which was not the case before because the hybrid seed was only available at the boma in Nsanje. The lead farmers encouraged us to use hybrid seed because it produced more yields when compared against local maize seed varieties. I managed to buy this seed because of the money I received from Organisation X I should not lie to you. As you can see me, I cannot afford such seed on my own without assistance. Regarding livestock, I have bought chickens in the past 4 months using the money I got from Organisation X so that I sell them when they multiply. I would want to use the money from selling chickens to feed my children. i bought chickens because they are cheaper than goats yet one is able to make ends meet by selling them. I started receiving money from Organisation X in October and I get MK15000 per month. There are no changes on time spent on farm production as far as me and my household are Organisation Xed. My plans for the future are that I would want to buy a plot to cultivate more maize which I would sell and use the money to buy ironsheets for my house.

These NGOs brought the hybrid seed to nearby markets so that people can easily access them because previously we used to travel long distances to get the hybrid seed at the Boma. Previously, we planted local millet but now we plant early maturity varieties due to the dry spells that frequent our district.; Organisation X also provided money to these beneficiaries to buy early maturing varieties as an impact mitigation measure against the effects of the drought.","With regards to farm production, I have implemented new farming techniques because of Organisation X; for instance I have adopted Mtayakhasu (zero tillage) this year in order to have more yields.

In addition to that money, I am able to borrow from the Organisation B group whenever the need arises.; My household's wellbeings has changed for the better thanks to the monthly assistance in form of money which we get from Organisation X. My children are happier now because they are not in trouble at school for not having uniforms, they have more time dedicated to their studies becasue they no longer have to work in the garden since I hire people to do all the work for us.

She also said that improved sanitation at household level and general health education delivered by the Health Surveillance Assistant (HSA) of the community. The same HSA promotes health seeking behaviour among the community members and she is practising that by seeking healthcare as early as she notices signs of sickness.

The respondent revealed that she is taking ARVs at the moment and feels stronger than before because she can afford a meal daily nowadays. In the past her health was fast detoriating because she was taking drugs on an empty stomach as her household was food insecure. Since 20xx she has been receiving money from Organisation X and this cash handout has improved her health through sustained food availability. Other members of the household have all been in good health over the past year.; You can agree with me that when you are not eating enough food per day and if you are having unbalanced meals, sicknesses caused by malnutrition will be the order of the day. In the case of my household, there has been an improvement in our health because we can afford to eat balanced meals at least 3 times a day.

Besides that, she also said that NGOs working in the area like Organisation E and Organisation X World Wide have been in the forefront advocating for the adoption of modern farming techniques in order to mitigate the impact of climate change which also affect agriculture production. \"We practice mixed cropping and after the rainy season we are encouraged to embark on irrigation farming. They sometimes give us early maturing varieties of maize and sweet potatoes. This made a difference by far\". Among other crops she grows gonkho (sorghum), pearl millet (mchewere), manduyi (groundnuts), chimbamba (beans) and rice. Apart from chickens she also rears ducks.

However, whenever there is a shortage of food, which has been a rare occurence in 20xx, the family skips some meals like breakfast or lunch. This practice was common in the previous years but rare at the moment because the household has money to feed themselves.; Before she bacame a social cash transfer beneficiary, she faced shortage at her household because she could not produce enough or raise enough money to buy food. But from October 20xx when she started receiving her first income from the social cash transfer program the burden became lighter. She no longer gathers wild foods .

There have been these changes because my husband was available this season and he purchased the inputs; before, he was not living with us much that is why we used to plant local maize variety. Regarding livestock, there are no changes because I have been keeping chickens for 5 years now and nothing has changed.

I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?; There has been a change in the way decisions are made over food and money. I am the one in charge of this because I am the one earning more money at the household. Before Organisation X, it was my husband who made all the decisions with regards to food and money because he was the one that was earning more than me. With work sharing, I now go to sell my bananas whilst he goes to work in the garden. Before Organisation X, both of us would go to the garden to work together or both of us would be at home when there was no work in the garden. With regards to dealing with emergencies, I can comfortably use the money I get from my business earnings to solve these. Before Organisation X, I was helpless, I had nowhere to run to because people cannot help you with money in this community because of deep-seated trust issues people have over money.","There are no changes in the decision making at household level Organisation Xing food and money but childcare has changed because now I can take care of my children in the absence of my wife because Organisation X has told us to be mindful of gender equality. With regards to asset use, there are no changes. However, when it comes to dealing with emergencies, there are changes because, before Organisation X came in, I would borrow money from my friends but that is no longer the case because I have the money to help me even in emergencies. If I happen not to have it, then I borrow from the Organisation B.","Respondent sells firewood which she collects from the mountain forest as a source of income generation. She also does piece work but now on a very small small scale compared to previous years. She also receives monthly income from Organisation X as a beneficiary of the Social Cash Transfer program. She also said that she receives remmittances from her relatives who work in town. The social cash transfer program which she joined in October 20xx has guaranteed her stable and consistent income which has helped to alleviate some problems faced by her household.; Important link to Organisation X - Organisation B: I can easily access loans to meet emergencies. I am expecting to taste the real benefits of this in October 20xx when we share out the money; Dealing with emergencies has changed because the money is now easily borrowed from the Organisation Bs managed by Organisation X and GOAL unlike in the past where we would ask from friends which was not easy.","She said that she and her son have enjoyed good health over the past year because of improved nourishment resulting from the bumper yield she realised last growing season due to the absence of natural disasters like floods which normally sweep the crops in the fields most of the time. She also said that improved sanitation at household level and general health education delivered by the Health Surveillance Assistant (HSA) of the community. The same HSA promotes health seeking behaviour among the community members and she is practising that by seeking healthcare as early as she notices signs of sickness. She accesses health care free at a government facility at Mbenje which is very close to her village. Sometimes she just buys drugs like painkillers in the shops when she has money. She further mentioned that she drinks treated water. The water source from which she draws water is disinfected with chlorine to prevent water borne illnesses.","Before she bacame a social cash transfer beneficiary, she faced shortage at her household because she could not produce enough or raise enough money to buy food. But from October 20xx when she started receiving her first income from the social cash transfer program the burden became lighter. She no longer gathers wild foods . The children can afford breakfast  nowadays because there is money to buy food. From the home kitchen garden she is able to grow vegetables for family consumption thereby spending less money on food. This year she has not experienced hunger during the lean months from December to February because she could always afford to buy the needed food.","The respondent said that in addition to the normal farming, she has a kitchen garden where the family grows vegetables for consumption in order to improve nutrition in the household. This is something new and she learnt this from Organisation X field officers. She has also learned mixed cropping using modern farming methods like conservation agriculture which does not use the traditional ridges. Farmers use maize stalks for mulching in order to conserve moisture, avoid erosion and improve soil fertility. For the first time she planted hybrid maize seeds for the first time because she was able to purchase using part of her cash handouts she receives from Organisation X. She was advised by Organisation X extension officers to plant one seed per hole at 25cm apart and this system of planting maize is called Technique3. The crops are mainly grown for home consumption. She has also purchased a goat for the first time using the same source of income. Going foward she wants to expand crop production by acquiring more farming land through land rentals. This farming season, the respondent said she had no time for piece work unlike the previous years because she could afford to buy food using part of the cash handouts she gets monthly from Organisation X.; We have been taught by Organisation X to plant kitchen gardens so that we eat balanced meals and sell some of the crops.","With the cash transfers from Organisation X, I am able to buy soap and food unlike before where I would not afford to do so. I am the one who decides what to spend the money on and how it should be spent because my husband died last year July so I am the head of the house now. With regards to saving money, I keep some money in my purse which I carry with me everywhere I go even in the bathroom. I keep this money with me for easy access whenever there arises a need at household level. I also save some of it in the Organisation B so that it accumulates interest. With the Organisation B, I am able to borrow money without difficulty whenever I need to. In the past I would borrow from my friends but it was not easy to be assisted because of lack of trust. Last year, I have managed to buy chickens and guinea fowls although they all died. In addition to this I have also bought 11 ironsheets using the same money I receive from Organisation X because my house leaks when it rains.","My household's wellbeings has changed for the better thanks to the monthly assistance in form of money which we get from Organisation X. My children are happier now because they are not in trouble at school for not having uniforms, they have more time dedicated to their studies becasue they no longer have to work in the garden since I hire people to do all the work for us. They are eating good quality food three times a day and they no longer complain of hunger.","Now I can hire ganyu to work on my farm which I wouldn't afford in the past so I have rested more than previously when I had to work a lot in my garden. With regards to dealing with emergencies, I have borrowed from the Organisation B group to resolve my situation. In the past, it was hard to access help from friends.","Important link to Health Surveillance Assistant - provide healthcare services: improve health of household members; My son was awarded a scholarship by certain Muslims to study for a degree in Agriculture in Country B. He left on 30th June 20xx. With regards to the health of my household, I am the only one who has been very ill during last year. Since April 20xx, when I first got ill, I have been going for medical check-ups so that I keep track of my overall health. In one of these check-ups, I was diagnosed with HIV. With this diagnosis, I started getting treatment and my health has improved  so much. I feel strong and energetic such that I can easily work in my garden.Based on this diagnosis, I have also been getting counselling on how I can live a healthy life despite being HIV positive. Organisation X for instance through their field assistants, counselled me on being faithful to my sexual partner in order to live longer. Organisation R also came in through its field workers and advised me on how best I can practise safe sex. These organisations through their field workers were moving from household to household in providing their counselling services. So to stay healthy, I have adjusted my way of life by incorporating the advice I got from Organisation X and Organisation R. I have resolved to heed to this advice because I want to live longer, take care of my family by providing for my wife and children financially which may be hard if not impossible if I am constantly bed-ridden.; The overall health of my family has improved because I know the status of my health and I also know what to do to live longer. Previously, I would just be sick without knowing what the real problem was so it was harder to be productive with regards to farming because I was mostly weak. Now I am stronger than I was beyond 12 months ago because I am receiving treatment from the hospital."," She further disclosed that government cash transfer is shared among several people are identified by the village leadership without the knowledge of the benefactors. The actual beneficiary is just fronted as if all the income is for her/him yet when the money comes other people in the village get a share. In the end the intended purpose of alleviating poverty is defeated because after splitting the cash the beneficiary remains with too little money to make any meaningful impact. Since chiefs are responsible for selection of beneficiaries the system is abused from the beginning. ","The realtionship has not changed much apart from the fact that some peope steal the new things she buys for household. She suspects that there are some jealousy people in the community who do not want her to move out of poverty. She bought a goat and they stole it. The thief has never been caught.","Some people outside the househld are jelousy of her success she has achieved as a beneficiary of the social cash transfer. Sometimes she is denied the opportunity to work on other paid community projects like Organisation C 4 allegedly because she is already a beneficiary elsewhere. However, she said that for all the community projects that require free labour she is able to dedicate the same amount of time just like any other person in the community.; Some said that external relationships have not changed while others cited segregation when it comes to participation in other paid jobs at community level. \"Village headmen hate us because during our selection as beneficiaries they never played any role and when we get our handouts they also play no role. They do not like the arrangement because there is nothing this project is benefitting them personally. Consequently we are taken off the list of whatever opportunity that comes in the village\". They are denied a chance to work on projects like Organisation C which pay those who participate in community projects. \"Some chiefs even frown at us when they see us buying meat or any asset\". When it comes to vouluntary community projects they are called upon to participate. Organisation X encourages their beneficiaries to participate fully in community activities.","She also claimed that there were unfounded allegations that all the beneficiaries of the social cash transfer being implemented by Organisation X have been initiated into a satanic cult and are being used by the organisation to propagate satanic worship in the community. ; The amount of time spent on activities with other people has increased because she now has more friends who are particularly members of the Organisation B group. The interaction between benficiaries is good but lamented that that non beneficiaries exhibit an element of jealous towards her because the economic gap between them is being bridged slowly. When it comes to other community projects in which particpants are paid, she is denied participation on account that she is already a benficiary of Organisation X's cash handouts. She feels this segregation has strained the relationship somehow with other community members. Other people in the society describe the Organisation X beneficiaries as sell outs who have accepted to join a satanic cult under the guise of social cash transfer. They claim that \"money cannot come so cheaply and sooner or later all those who partake in the bloody money will face reality when the devil decides to harvest what he is sowing in them right now\". Respondent thinks this is pure manifestation of jealousy from people who don't wish her well and doesn't care.","While his family is celebrating the economic transformation and overall unity within the household other members of the community have become jealousy of the success he has achieved and are treating him with disdain. Consequently they are forcing him to pay for rentals on borrowed gardens he used to farm freely when he was a pauper. On the other hand he said he relates very well with NGOs and other authorities within the community.","The amount of time spent on activities with other people has increased because she now has more friends who are particularly members of the Organisation B group.

However, there are no cahnges in the health of the household.; The only change in the composition of my household is the leaving of my son for Country A to do ganyu. He left last year October. With regards to the health of my household, there has been an improvement since we started receiving moey from Organisation X last year October. My children used to suffer from malnutrition but now they are strong and healthy because I can afford to provide a balanced diet for them using this MK 15000 i receive per month from Organisation X","The only change that has happened regarding the composition of my household is the fact that my son left in October to live with my brother because we were having economic problems and my brother decided to take my son to lessen the economic burden in my household. Regarding our health, we are stronger and healthier now because we are eating three times a day as a result of the money we receive from Organisation X.","Apart from the Organisation X social cash transfer program, she is also a beneficiary of another social cash transfer program which started in 20xx and is being implemented by the government through Social Welfare. This income from government is erratic and sometimes beneficiaries can stay for 3 months without payment.","With the advice on good agricultural practices from Organisation X, I have been  involved more than ever before in farm production such that I even bought fertilizer this season using the money received from Organisation X. Although I am also benefiting from the social cash transfer program from the government, the money does not come on a monthly basis such that I have to borrow from friends in order to survive; when the cash transfer comes in, I use it to repay my loans. But with Organisation X, I have managed to buy fertilizer becasue the money is more than the social cash transfer one and becasue it is given to us every month. All in all, I am expecting more yields this season as a result of the advice from Organisation X.; Important link to Social Cash Transfer - Cash transfer: No change because there is no consistency in their support so I ended up using that money to pay debts.","The only change that has happened regarding the composition of my household is the fact that my son left in October to live with my brother because we were having economic problems and my brother decided to take my son to lessen the economic burden in my household.

Local varieties of maize were mostly late maturing and this was unsustainable because the rains stopped before the crops had matured and the family frequently faced food shortages. The family has also adopted the cultivation of other crops like potatoes, sorghum and beans just to make sure the household is food secure even if one crop fails to do well. The respondent said that they grow more maize and less sorghum. Growing many types fo crops has a cost of its own. The extra crops require extra gardens. The family does not own enough land. They rent extra land at K5,000 per growing season which they cannot easily afford as they have other critically important issues that need money. Over the past years the time spent on farmimg activities has reduced mainly because of the drought. Some crops failed to germinate and some gardens were bandoned hence reduction on labour demand for farming. Organizations like Organisation X are ewncouraging people like him to practice winter cropping to make up for the loss of yields due to droughts.","The household now plants early maturing varieties of maize to mitigate the impact of climate change which among other things results into inadequte rainfall in the area.

This technique is being promoted by Organisation X field officers in the area. She grows more maize than sorghum because sorghum is grown upland which is not fertile enough while maize is growing along the river banks after the rains which are more fertile. Last growing season she did not produce enough because she spent most of her time caring for a sick relative during the planting season. Since she became a beneficiary of Organisation X, she has reduced her time doing piece work. Therefore she is able to dedicate more time to her own projects. Using part of the money she receives from Organisation X every month, she has manageed to buy chickens which she is rearing now will be selling in the future to absorb the unforeseeable shocks. However, some people are stealing her chickens and this is a big threat to her vision of self reliance.","With regards to assets sold, people have sold goats due to economic hardship or even trying to pay school fees. People are selling livestock because they cannot sell much crop due to dry spells so livestock is the second best option to making money.","The major change to my household composition is the death of my husband in July 20xx. There is no one who has joined this household since last year.

In\nthe main garden he has grown maize, sorghum, sweet potatoes and pearl millet\n(mchewere). Unlike the previous years, the respondent said that he applied\ncompost manure to his crops. He also used conservation agricultural methods\nwhich lesrned from Organisation X extension officers. He grew more maize than\nany other crop because they consume it more than any food. This year's yield has\nbeen affected by the outbreak of fall worms but will still be better that what\nhe produced last year on the same piece of land. Sorghum is mostly grown upland\nbut most often it does not do well because of the drought as well as floods that\nare caused by runoff water from the mountains. Because of this setback he grows\nless of this crop. The family has no livestock at the moment but intends to buy\na goat in the near future as part of income diversification strategy. To ensure\nfood security the respindent said that he also plans to to embark on winter\ncropping along the irrigable land along the river.

Local varieties of maize were mostly late\nmaturing and this was unsustainable because the rains stopped before the crops\nhad matured and the family frequently faced food shortages. The family has also\nadopted the cultivation of other crops like potatoes, sorghum and beans just\nto make sure the household is food secure even if one crop fails to do well.\nThe respondent said that they grow more maize and less sorghum. Growing many\ntypes fo crops has a cost of its own. The extra crops require extra gardens.\nThe family does not own enough land. They rent extra land at K5,000 per\ngrowing season which they cannot easily afford as they have other critically\nimportant issues that need money. Over the past years the time spent on farmimg\nactivities has reduced mainly because of the drought. Some crops failed to\ngerminate and some gardens were bandoned hence reduction on labour demand for\nfarming. Organizations like Organisation X are ewncouraging people like him to\npractice winter cropping to make up for the loss of yields due to droughts.<\/br>\nImportant link to - provide agriculture expertise: more yield for improved food\nsecurity<\/br> The respondent was taught modern farming methods like \"Technique1\"\nwhich is a conservation agriculture technique. With this type of farming method,\na small piece of land produces high yields compared to ordinary farming methods\nwhich the respondent has been using over the past years. Organisation X trained\nher and other beneficiaries on the use of modern farming methods to improve\nfood security. This growing season she planted sorghum, maize, pearl millet\n(mchewere), groundnuts and sweet potatoes. Maize has not done well because of\nthe fall army worms which damaged the crops in the field. She grew more maize\nbecause it is a staple food and grew less groundnuts due to shortage of farmimg\nland. All the crops are grown primarily for household consumption. Being an\nold lady, she says she is not very productive nowadays as her body is becomimg\nfrail. The labour demand compels her to only cultivate a sizeable garden which\nshe can manage to work on. Organisation X provided her with sweet potato stem\ncuttings so that she can plant in the swampy areas when the rains are over in\norder to be food secure.<\/p>","<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-9; mjf-30<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:51; 564<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:c1_please tell me about any changes in farm production (both the crops you grow\nand the animals you look after) as a household, both to earn income and for your\nown consumption?; d1_d1. please tell me about the other things you and others in\nthis area do to earn money, and get food and other things: how has this changed\nover the last year?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>The respondent said that in addition to the normal farming, she has a kitchen\ngarden where the family grows vegetables for consumption in order to improve\nnutrition in the household.

Before this program she was not not saving her\nincome anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months\nshe has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes,\ncharcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She\nborrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back\nwith an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that\nthrough this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.<\/\nbr> I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money\nI get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items\nwhich were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is\nmy husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning\nmore than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how\nmoney is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X.\nWith regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly\nvisible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which\nwas not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly\non saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X\nand instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some\nof it at the Organisation B group. So far, I can easily borrow money from the\nOrganisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group,\nI could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not\ntrust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for ganyus to\nsolve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I\njust bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation\nX. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so\nthat I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my\ncommunity making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?<\/br>\nI have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I\nget Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money\nto start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in\nthe Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my\nmoney accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from\nOrganisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the\nfish selling business I am operating.

In the past years the\nfamily used to starve because they could not manage to procure enough food.\nMost often during the lean period which is between December and March the\nfamily would skip meals or go to bed hungry because there was no food to eat.\nIn extreme circumstances she would sell household property like a blanket\njust to afford food. She would also gather wild food in the forest in order to\nsuppliment the household food. However, this has not happened this year since\nhousehold became a beneficiary of the social cash transfer from Organisation X\nin October 20xx. Going forward, she plans to have as many livestocks as possible\nat her household so that she can sell one of them whenever faced with a problem\nin the future. She has already bought a goat using earnings from Organisation\nX. She also plans to expand her business by starting selling second hand clothes\nwhen she gets shares from the Organisation B group where she saves money.<\/br>\nThis farming season the family adopted conservation agriculture farming methods\nwhich improve moisture retention in view of the erratic rainfall. This technique\nis being promoted by Organisation X field officers in the area. She grows more\nmaize than sorghum because sorghum is grown upland which is not fertile enough\nwhile maize is growing along the river banks after the rains which are more\nfertile. Last growing season she did not produce enough because she spent most\nof her time caring for a sick relative during the planting season. Since she\nbecame a beneficiary of Organisation X, she has reduced her time doing piece\nwork. Therefore she is able to dedicate more time to her own projects. Using\npart of the money she receives from Organisation X every month, she has manageed\nto buy chickens which she is rearing now will be selling in the future to absorb\nthe unforeseeable shocks. However, some people are stealing her chickens and\nthis is a big threat to her vision of self reliance.<\/br> Farm production in my\nhousehold has improved because Organisation X has been giving us hybrid maize\nseed which produces more yield compared to local seed and they have also been\ngiving us sweetpotato seedlings which help us earn extra income after selling\nthe produce. Before last year, I was only planting local maize variety which\nwould give me 10 bags of 50kgs but with the hybrid maize, I have harvetsed 18\nbags of 50kg. With regards to livestock, thieves stole my 3 goats and ducks\nwhich I bought last year for the purpose of selling them when they multiply\nso that I use the money earned to build my dream home. At the moment I am not\nkeeping any livestock. Over the last year, I have dedicated more time on farm\nproduction because I have the money from the Organisation X Organisation B and\nseed from the same NGO which was not the case before. I could not cultivate\nevery garden I had because I could barely afford the inputs. But that has all\nchanged, I can afford to cultivate all my gardens but I deliberately leave some\nuncultivated because I want to rent them out to others to earn extra money. I\ncan afford to buy farm inputs because of the money I receive from Organisation\nX. In future, I would want to buy cattle and goats so that I sell them and\nuse the money to build my dream house which would be bigger than the one I am\nliving in now. The plot where the house would be built would be big enough to\neven allow my children to build their own houses there as well.<\/br> I used\nto do ganyu in other people's farms in the years before I started benefiting\nfrom Organisation X. Now I no longer see the need to do ganyu because I have\nthe money which I receive every month from Organisation X to meet my needs. I\nhave even invested some of that money into buying bananas which I sell. I chose\nto invest some of this money into the banana selling business because bananas\nare expensive here and therefore fetch alot of money on the market when sold.\nI am planning on buying goats in the future so that I can sell them when they\nmultiply.Overall, the time I spend on income generation has increased because I\nam busy selling bananas everyday unlike before when I used to do ganyu because\nit was not everyday that I would have ganyu work.

The lead farmers encouraged us to use hybrid seed because\nit produced more yields when compared against local maize seed varieties. I\nmanaged to buy this seed because of the money I received from Organisation X I\nshould not lie to you. As you can see me, I cannot afford such seed on my own\nwithout assistance. Regarding livestock, I have bought chickens in the past\n4 months using the money I got from Organisation X so that I sell them when\nthey multiply.

Organisation\nX pays him K15,000 monthly. Part of this money was used to purchase hybrid\nmaize seeds which are not only high yielding but also early maturing. Perviously\nhe used to grow some local maize varieties because he could not afford to\nbuy hybrid seeds on the market. Local varieties were mostly late maturing and\nlow yielding and not suitable for an area which frequently faces unreliable\nrains. This year he grew maize, sorghum and sugarcanes. Sugarcane is the newest\ncrop to be cultivated as a cash crop upon advice from Organisation X. He has\ncultivated it for the very first time. He has grown more maize than sorghum\nthis year because of late the latter has not been doing well up field because\nof drought.

He also used conservation agricultural methods\nwhich lesrned from Organisation X extension officers. He grew more maize than\nany other crop because they consume it more than any food. This year's yield\nhas been affected by the outbreak of fall worms but will still be better that\nwhat he produced last year on the same piece of land. Sorghum is mostly grown\nupland but most often it does not do well because of the drought as well as\nfloods that are caused by runoff water from the mountains.

Organisation X pays\nhim K15,000 monthly. Part of this money was used to purchase hybrid maize seeds\nwhich are not only high yielding but also early maturing. Perviously he used\nto grow some local maize varieties because he could not afford to buy hybrid\nseeds on the market. Local varieties were mostly late maturing and low yielding\nand not suitable for an area which frequently faces unreliable rains. This\nyear he grew maize, sorghum and sugarcanes. Sugarcane is the newest crop to be\ncultivated as a cash crop upon advice from Organisation X. He has cultivated\nit for the very first time. He has grown more maize than sorghum this year\nbecause of late the latter has not been doing well up field because of drought.\nMaize is also grown through irrigation as this makes up for the loss caused by\nthe drought. The respondent has also grown sweet potatoes whose cuttings were\nsupplied by Organisation X to enhace foosd security at household level. The\nsweet potatoes are being grown along the river banks. Besides crop production,\nthe respondent has bought a chicken for rearing to caution his income. Hr\nfurther intends to buy a goat for the same purpose. All these plans have come\nout of the trainings Organisation X has been offering to all the beneficiaries\nof their interventions.<\/br> The respondent was taught modern farming methods\nlike \"Technique1\" which is a conservation agriculture technique. With this\ntype of farming method, a small piece of land produces high yields compared\nto ordinary farming methods which the respondent has been using over the past\nyears. Organisation X trained her and other beneficiaries on the use of modern\nfarming methods to improve food security. This growing season she planted\nsorghum, maize, pearl millet (mchewere), groundnuts and sweet potatoes. Maize\nhas not done well because of the fall army worms which damaged the crops in the\nfield. She grew more maize because it is a staple food and grew less groundnuts\ndue to shortage of farmimg land. All the crops are grown primarily for household\nconsumption. Being an old lady, she says she is not very productive nowadays\nas her body is becomimg frail. The labour demand compels her to only cultivate\na sizeable garden which she can manage to work on. Organisation X provided her\nwith sweet potato stem cuttings so that she can plant in the swampy areas when\nthe rains are over in order to be food secure.<\/br> The respondent said that\nthis growing season he has opened a kitchen garden at his home for vegetable\nproduction which are meant for family consumption. In the main garden he has\ngrown maize, sorghum, sweet potatoes and pearl millet (mchewere). Unlike the\nprevious years, the respondent said that he applied compost manure to his crops.\nHe also used conservation agricultural methods which lesrned from Organisation X\nextension officers. He grew more maize than any other crop because they consume\nit more than any food. This year's yield has been affected by the outbreak of\nfall worms but will still be better that what he produced last year on the same\npiece of land. Sorghum is mostly grown upland but most often it does not do well\nbecause of the drought as well as floods that are caused by runoff water from\nthe mountains. Because of this setback he grows less of this crop. The family\nhas no livestock at the moment but intends to buy a goat in the near future as\npart of income diversification strategy. To ensure food security the respindent\nsaid that he also plans to to embark on winter cropping along the irrigable land\nalong the river. He has already been given sweet potato cuttings by Organisation\nX for the same purpose. The respondent revealed that this growing season he\nhas reduced the time for doing piece work because he is able to earn money\nmonthly. Consequently he has more time now to produce his own food crops for the\nbetterment of his family.<\/p>","<a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_edit_743\">Edit link<\/a><\/br><a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_delete_743\">Delete link<\/a><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:ncm-13<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:420<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:d1_please tell me about the other things your household does to earn money, food\nand to get other things? how has this changed over the last year?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>For a long time I have been relying on selling farm produce like maize as\na source of income.

However, with Organisation X, I have also been selling\nsweetpotatoes because the organisation gave us some seedlings. In the years\nbefore last year, I would only sell maize but now I can also sell sweetpotatoes\nin addition to the maize. Most importantly, I have joined the Organisation B\ngroup in my village which is managed by Organisation X again. This has made\na very big difference in my savings because before joining this Organisation\nB, I would rely on getting loans from my friends whenever I was facing an\nemergency. Accessing help from my friends was not guaranteed because some of\nmy friends would tell me that they did not have the kind of money I needed.\nBefore last year, I used to drink alot such that I was not able to save any\nmoney. When I made my decision to quit drinking last year, I thought I would\nsave the money I was using for drinking into a Organisation B group and use\nthe money for worthwhile causes. What motivated me to join this Organisation\nB was the fact that I always saw my friends engaging in businesses and taking\ncare of their families whilst I was unable to do so because I did not know how\nto save money. In the future, I would want to grow alot of beans so that I can\nearn more money than I am now because beans in this community fetch more money\nthan any other crops including sweetpotatoes. For the sweetpotato, it is the\nseedlings that fetch more money on the market than the potatoes themselves. In\nthis case I am also planning to sell sweetpotato seedlings.<\/br> As a household\nhead and breadwinner, I used to spend more on beer in the period before last\nyear. However, that has changed since I quit drinking last year and joined the\nOrganisation B. I use the money for building my house which was not the case\nbefore. I can buy shoes for my children such that they no longer walk barefooted\nto school as was the case before I joined the Organisation B group. When I was\ndrinking, those I was drinking with would dictate how I should spend my money\nbut ever since I quit and joined the Organisation B, i am soley responsible\nfor every decision that is made on spending in the household. I decided to quit\ndrinking and join the Organisation B group because I was reflecting on how my\npeers were doing better than I was because they were saving money. The money we\nhave as a family is saved in the Organisation B because it accumulates interest\nwhich can be used to buy household necessities including food as well as shelter\nby building a house which I am doing at the moment. Apart from myself, my wife\nand all my children are in Organisation B groups but they are not operated by\nNGOs. These are groups that are just created by people in the community. They\nhave joined these community Organisation Bs in January and are yet to share out\nthe money. My expectation is that the economic burden of meeting all their needs\non an individual basis will be lessened. By joining the Organisation B group, I\nno longer have the need to borrow from my friends and no longer have the need to\nhave debts because the money I get from the Organisation B caters for the many\nthings that are needed in my household. I have not bought or sold any assets but\nI am planning on buying goats to replace those that were stolen last December.\nI would want to be rearing them and sell them when they multiply so that I can\nlive a comfortable life and build my dream house.<\/p>","<a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_edit_987\">Edit link<\/a><\/br><a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_delete_987\">Delete link<\/a><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:nbm-18<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:551<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:g2_please tell me how your relationships with others living in this village have\nchanged over the last year?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Relationships have improved because with the coming of NGOs like Organisation X,\nwe are able to work together in the community.

With this type of farming method, a small\npiece of land produces high yields compared to ordinary farming methods which\nthe respondent has been using over the past years. Organisation X trained\nher and other beneficiaries on the use of modern farming methods to improve\nfood security. This growing season she planted sorghum, maize, pearl millet\n(mchewere), groundnuts and sweet potatoes. Maize has not done well because of\nthe fall army worms which damaged the crops in the field. She grew more maize\nbecause it is a staple food and grew less groundnuts due to shortage of farmimg\nland. All the crops are grown primarily for household consumption. Being an\nold lady, she says she is not very productive nowadays as her body is becomimg\nfrail. The labour demand compels her to only cultivate a sizeable garden which\nshe can manage to work on. Organisation X provided her with sweet potato stem\ncuttings so that she can plant in the swampy areas when the rains are over in\norder to be food secure.<\/br> The respondent said that this growing season he\nhas opened a kitchen garden at his home for vegetable production which are meant\nfor family consumption. In the main garden he has grown maize, sorghum, sweet\npotatoes and pearl millet (mchewere). Unlike the previous years, the respondent\nsaid that he applied compost manure to his crops. He also used conservation\nagricultural methods which lesrned from Organisation X extension officers.\nHe grew more maize than any other crop because they consume it more than any\nfood. This year's yield has been affected by the outbreak of fall worms but\nwill still be better that what he produced last year on the same piece of land.\nSorghum is mostly grown upland but most often it does not do well because of the\ndrought as well as floods that are caused by runoff water from the mountains.\nBecause of this setback he grows less of this crop.

He has already been given sweet potato cuttings by Organisation\nX for the same purpose.

Apart from the Organisation\nX social cash transfer program, she is also a beneficiary of another social\ncash transfer program which started in 20xx and is being implemented by the\ngovernment through Social Welfare. This income from government is erratic and\nsometimes beneficiaries can stay for 3 months without payment. But the one\nfrom Organisation X is the most guaranteed source of income for the household.\nBefore becoming a Organisation X social cash transfer beneficiary last year,\nshe used to do piece work for survival. She would spend several weeks in Country\nA to work on the farms so that she could earn money to sustain her family.\nBut nowadays she is also able to earn money through selling tomatoes which\nshe grows in her garden.

The actual\nbeneficiary is just fronted as if all the income is for her/him yet when the\nmoney comes other people in the village get a share. In the end the intended\npurpose of alleviating poverty is defeated because after splitting the cash\nthe beneficiary remains with too little money to make any meaningful impact.\nSince chiefs are responsible for selection of beneficiaries the system is abused\nfrom the beginning. But the Organisation X Wordwide social cash transfer is\nnot being abused by the chiefs because selection of beneficiaries was done when\nthey did own assessment for eligibility before recruitment.<\/br> I had no food\nin the past but now I have food because I applied fertilizer this year. In the\npast, I used to plant local maize variety but since the 20xx/18 agricultural\nseason, I have grown hybrid maize. I have also grown groundnuts and soya to sell\nat the market. There have been these changes because my husband was available\nthis season and he purchased the inputs<\/br> before, he was not living with\nus much that is why we used to plant local maize variety. Regarding livestock,\nthere are no changes because I have been keeping chickens for 5 years now and\nnothing has changed. Overall, there are no changes in the time spent on farm\nproduction in my household. In the future, I would want to grow more soya and\ngroundnuts for sale and use the earnings from such sales to buy farm inputs like\nfertilizer so that we have more yields.<\/br> With regards to farm production,\nI have implemented new farming techniques because of Organisation X<\/br> for\ninstance I have adopted Mtayakhasu (zero tillage) this year in order to have\nmore yields. Regarding new crops I have grown this season, for the first time, I\nhave grown groundnuts which were made available at our market by Organisation X.\nI have grown groundnuts because they fetch alot of money once sold and they are\nnutritious. I have also grown sugarcane this season for the purpose of selling\nthem to earn extra income based on the advice by Organisation X that we have to\nbe self-dependent. In the case of livestock, I have bought 3 chickens this year\nin February so that I sell them when they multiply. I used the part of the money\nI receive per month from Organisation X to buy these chickens. Overall, the time\nI spend with farm production has increased because I am no longer doing ganyu.\nThe advice on good agricultural practices from Organisation X has also meant\nthat I spend more time with farm production than before where I would pay little\nattention to my crops and I would not follow proper procedures in farming. In\nfuture, I would want to get a tradle pump or engine pump to engage in irrigation\nfarming and grow onions and tomatoes which fetch alot of money here.<\/p>","<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-10; ncm-19; nbm-21; nbf-23; mkf-8<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:75; 271; 320; 368; 26<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA;<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:c1_please tell me about any changes in farm production (both the crops you grow\nand the animals you look after) as a household, both to earn income and for your\nown consumption?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>The family normally grows maize which is their main staple crop. They also\ngrow other crops such as soya beans, groundnuts and sweet potatoes. During the\nlast growing season, the family adopted some new farming methodologies such as\nconservation agriculture as well as Technique3 type of maize planting (one seed\nper hole at 25cm apart). They used compost manure this time and they were taught\nall these by extension workers from Organisation X. She cultivates more maize\nthan any other crop because that is the primary food crop. She cultivates less\nsweet potatoes because of shortage of farming land. She has also abandoned the\nuse of local maize varieties because of their little yield and failure to mature\nin time in the face of erratic rainfall being experienced these days. In the\nfuture she plans to grow more beans for commercial purposes in order to generate\nmore income for the family. Organisation X advises them to diversify crops in\norder to achieve food security at the household level even if one crop fails.<\/\nbr> The household now plants early maturing varieties of maize to mitigate\nthe impact of climate change which among other things results into inadequte\nrainfall in the area. Local varieties of maize were mostly late maturing and\nthis was unsustainable because the rains stopped before the crops had matured\nand the family frequently faced food shortages. The family has also adopted the\ncultivation of other crops like potatoes, sorghum and beans just to make sure\nthe household is food secure even if one crop fails to do well. The respondent\nsaid that they grow more maize and less sorghum. Growing many types fo crops\nhas a cost of its own. The extra crops require extra gardens. The family does\nnot own enough land. They rent extra land at K5,000 per growing season which\nthey cannot easily afford as they have other critically important issues that\nneed money. Over the past years the time spent on farmimg activities has reduced\nmainly because of the drought. Some crops failed to germinate and some gardens\nwere bandoned hence reduction on labour demand for farming. Organizations like\nOrganisation X are ewncouraging people like him to practice winter cropping to\nmake up for the loss of yields due to droughts.<\/br> The respondent said that\nduring this past growing season he was able to dedicate more time to his farm\nwork more than the previous years. Organisation X pays him K15,000 monthly. Part\nof this money was used to purchase hybrid maize seeds which are not only high\nyielding but also early maturing. Perviously he used to grow some local maize\nvarieties because he could not afford to buy hybrid seeds on the market. Local\nvarieties were mostly late maturing and low yielding and not suitable for an\narea which frequently faces unreliable rains. This year he grew maize, sorghum\nand sugarcanes. Sugarcane is the newest crop to be cultivated as a cash crop\nupon advice from Organisation X. He has cultivated it for the very first time.\nHe has grown more maize than sorghum this year because of late the latter has\nnot been doing well up field because of drought. Maize is also grown through\nirrigation as this makes up for the loss caused by the drought. The respondent\nhas also grown sweet potatoes whose cuttings were supplied by Organisation X\nto enhace foosd security at household level. The sweet potatoes are being grown\nalong the river banks. Besides crop production, the respondent has bought a\nchicken for rearing to caution his income. Hr further intends to buy a goat for\nthe same purpose. All these plans have come out of the trainings Organisation\nX has been offering to all the beneficiaries of their interventions.<\/br>\nThe respondent was taught modern farming methods like \"Technique1\" which is a\nconservation agriculture technique. With this type of farming method, a small\npiece of land produces high yields compared to ordinary farming methods which\nthe respondent has been using over the past years. Organisation X trained\nher and other beneficiaries on the use of modern farming methods to improve\nfood security. This growing season she planted sorghum, maize, pearl millet\n(mchewere), groundnuts and sweet potatoes. Maize has not done well because of\nthe fall army worms which damaged the crops in the field. She grew more maize\nbecause it is a staple food and grew less groundnuts due to shortage of farmimg\nland. All the crops are grown primarily for household consumption. Being an\nold lady, she says she is not very productive nowadays as her body is becomimg\nfrail. The labour demand compels her to only cultivate a sizeable garden which\nshe can manage to work on. Organisation X provided her with sweet potato stem\ncuttings so that she can plant in the swampy areas when the rains are over\nin order to be food secure.<\/br> Cassava has been grown for the first time to\ncompliment the food supply at the household.<\/p>","<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-12; mkf-2<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:123; 162<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:c3_what is the main reason for any changes?; c1_please tell me about any changes\nin farm production (both the crops you grow and the animals you look after) as a\nhousehold, both to earn income and for your own consumption?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Adoption of modern farming methods as well as crop diversification resulted into\nmore farming activities being performed last year than before.<\/br> Previously,\nI used to grow groundnuts and soya in addition to maize but they were not doing\nwell due to the weather.

Previously, I\nused to plant local maize seed because it was readily available, and cheap. I\nhave been able to switch to hybrid seed because there were lead farmers from\nOrganisation X that taught us good agricultural practices and brought the hybrid\nseed closer to us at the market which was not the case before because the hybrid\nseed was only available at the boma in Nsanje. The lead farmers encouraged us\nto use hybrid seed because it produced more yields when compared against local\nmaize seed varieties. I managed to buy this seed because of the money I received\nfrom Organisation X I should not lie to you. As you can see me, I cannot afford\nsuch seed on my own without assistance. Regarding livestock, I have bought\nchickens in the past 4 months using the money I got from Organisation X so\nthat I sell them when they multiply. I would want to use the money from selling\nchickens to feed my children. i bought chickens because they are cheaper than\ngoats yet one is able to make ends meet by selling them.

My plans for the future are that I would want to buy a plot\nto cultivate more maize which I would sell and use the money to buy ironsheets\nfor my house. Maize fetches alot of money here because it is a commodity that\nquickly becomes scarce once harvested due to the dry spells that we face every\nyear.<\/br> Organisation X has taught us to use hybrid maize and even cultivate\na variety of crops including sweetpotatoes, beans, soya as well as groundnuts.<\/\nbr> In the past people planted local maize but now they are using Hybrid seed\nbecause of extension worker advice from Organisation X and GOAL. These NGOs\nbrought the hybrid seed to nearby markets so that people can easily access them\nbecause previously we used to travel long distances to get the hybrid seed at\nthe Boma.

This is something new and she learnt this from\nOrganisation X field officers. She has also learned mixed cropping using modern\nfarming methods like conservation agriculture which does not use the traditional\nridges. Farmers use maize stalks for mulching in order to conserve moisture,\navoid erosion and improve soil fertility. For the first time she planted\nhybrid maize seeds for the first time because she was able to purchase using\npart of her cash handouts she receives from Organisation X. She was advised by\nOrganisation X extension officers to plant one seed per hole at 25cm apart and\nthis system of planting maize is called Technique3. The crops are mainly grown\nfor home consumption. She has also purchased a goat for the first time using\nthe same source of income. Going foward she wants to expand crop production\nby acquiring more farming land through land rentals. This farming season, the\nrespondent said she had no time for piece work unlike the previous years because\nshe could afford to buy food using part of the cash handouts she gets monthly\nfrom Organisation X.<\/br> Adoption of new farmimg techniques introduced by\nOrganisation X has improved crop output compared to previous years when she was\nusing local methods of farming. She also had more time doing her on farm work\nthan looking for casual labour elsewhere. The income she gets from Organisation\nX helped to fill the gap and she was able to sustain her household needs hence\nmore time to concentrate on her own farming. She was able to plant high yielding\nand early maturing hybrid seeds which she bought from Agro dealers using money\nshe gets from Organisation X.<\/br> For the first time in my life, I have bought\nhybrid maize seed and planted it in my garden last year. Previously, I used to\nplant local maize seed because it was readily available, and cheap. I have been\nable to switch to hybrid seed because there were lead farmers from Organisation\nX that taught us good agricultural practices and brought the hybrid seed closer\nto us at the market which was not the case before because the hybrid seed was\nonly available at the boma in Nsanje. The lead farmers encouraged us to use\nhybrid seed because it produced more yields when compared against local maize\nseed varieties. I managed to buy this seed because of the money I received from\nOrganisation X I should not lie to you. As you can see me, I cannot afford such\nseed on my own without assistance. Regarding livestock, I have bought chickens\nin the past 4 months using the money I got from Organisation X so that I sell\nthem when they multiply. I would want to use the money from selling chickens\nto feed my children. i bought chickens because they are cheaper than goats yet\none is able to make ends meet by selling them. I started receiving money from\nOrganisation X in October and I get MK15000 per month. There are no changes on\ntime spent on farm production as far as me and my household are Organisation\nXed. My plans for the future are that I would want to buy a plot to cultivate\nmore maize which I would sell and use the money to buy ironsheets for my house.\nMaize fetches alot of money here because it is a commodity that quickly becomes\nscarce once harvested due to the dry spells that we face every year.<\/p>","<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-12; ncm-19; ncf-20; nbm-21; nbf-22; nbf-14; nbm-18<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:131; 286; 310; 336; 345; 449; 453; 550<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:f5_what is the main reason for this change?; i1a_important links to\norganisations, activity & change; i1c_important links to organisations, activity\n& change; d1_please tell me about the other things your household does to\nearn money, food and to get other things? how has this changed over the last\nyear?; f1_please tell me about how your household spends and saves money? has\nit changed in the last year?; g1_please tell me how relationships within your\nhousehold have changed over the last year?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'><p> link_quotes Multiple quotes <\/p><\/p>","<a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_edit_144\">Edit link<\/a><\/br><a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_delete_144\">Delete link<\/a><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-10<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:88<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:h4_please explain your answers<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Household members now live a better quality life because they can afford\nmeals in the right quantities.

They no longer gather wild foods during the hungry months because the available cash is used to purchase food from the market. The social cash transfer program has brought about this change. Before this program sometimes the family would not afford three meals a day but now they are able to have three meals which include breakfast, lunch and supper.; There is more peace in the family now than before. Children are happy because they are able have regular meals.  In terms of decision making, she is the one who makes major financial decisions at the household. Household responsibilities are shared among the members notwithstanding their gender. Organisation X promotes gender equality and therefore beneficiaries have embraced the concept of sharing roles and responsibilities equally at the household.; She has enough food for household and her business is thriving since October 20xx. Overall, she is a happier person compared to previous years. Increased assets she has acquired is testimony of her improved wellbeing.; The relationship has improved over the past months because the children from this household are no longer food beggars in the community which was something that strained the relationship between parents. On the other hand, she claimed that her economic improvement has attracted some jealousy from people who do not wish her well. She is not allowed to benefit from other programs that offer financial assistance like the Organisation C Program in which people work on a community project and get paid. She is denied on account that she already benefiiting from the program implemented by Organisation X. \"You cannot have everything for yourself. Everybody needs money and you have to give a chance to other people to also benefit from other programs as you enjoy assistance from Organisation X\".","This beneficiary is also a member of a local Organisation B group where she saves her money. Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer program is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed under the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if saving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her income anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months she has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes, charcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She borrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back with an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that through this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.; I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?; I have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I get Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money to start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in the Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my money accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from Organisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the fish selling  business I am operating. My future plans are to expand my business by also selling tomatoes and bananas in addition to the fish I am already selling. I am planning on doing this because tomato selling and banana selling businesses are lucrative.","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically.

The social cash transfer\nprogram has brought about this change. Before this program sometimes the\nfamily would not afford three meals a day but now they are able to have three\nmeals which include breakfast, lunch and supper.<\/br> There is more peace\nin the family now than before. Children are happy because they are able have\nregular meals. In terms of decision making, she is the one who makes major\nfinancial decisions at the household. Household responsibilities are shared\namong the members notwithstanding their gender. Organisation X promotes gender\nequality and therefore beneficiaries have embraced the concept of sharing roles\nand responsibilities equally at the household.<\/br> She has enough food for\nhousehold and her business is thriving since October 20xx. Overall, she is a\nhappier person compared to previous years. Increased assets she has acquired\nis testimony of her improved wellbeing.<\/br> The relationship has improved over\nthe past months because the children from this household are no longer food\nbeggars in the community which was something that strained the relationship\nbetween parents. On the other hand, she claimed that her economic improvement\nhas attracted some jealousy from people who do not wish her well. She is not\nallowed to benefit from other programs that offer financial assistance like\nthe Organisation C Program in which people work on a community project and get\npaid. She is denied on account that she already benefiiting from the program\nimplemented by Organisation X. \"You cannot have everything for yourself.\nEverybody needs money and you have to give a chance to other people to also\nbenefit from other programs as you enjoy assistance from Organisation X\".<\/p>","<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mkf-8; nbf-14; nbf-17<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:33; 449; 517<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:f1_please tell me about how your household spends and saves money? has it\nchanged in the last year?; d1_please tell me about the other things your\nhousehold does to earn money, food and to get other things? how has this changed\nover the last year?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>This beneficiary is also a member of a local Organisation B group where she\nsaves her money. Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer\nprogram is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed\nunder the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if\nsaving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her\nincome anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months\nshe has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes,\ncharcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She\nborrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back\nwith an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that\nthrough this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.<\/\nbr> I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money\nI get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items\nwhich were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is\nmy husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning\nmore than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how\nmoney is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X.\nWith regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly\nvisible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which\nwas not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly\non saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X\nand instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some\nof it at the Organisation B group. So far, I can easily borrow money from the\nOrganisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group,\nI could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not\ntrust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for ganyus to\nsolve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I\njust bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation\nX. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so\nthat I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my\ncommunity making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?<\/br>\nI have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I\nget Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money\nto start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in\nthe Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my\nmoney accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from\nOrganisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the\nfish selling business I am operating. My future plans are to expand my business\nby also selling tomatoes and bananas in addition to the fish I am already\nselling. I am planning on doing this because tomato selling and banana selling\nbusinesses are lucrative.<\/p>","<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-7; nbm-24<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:11; 401<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:f5_what is the main reason for this change?; f3_what is the main reason for this\nchange?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a\nbusiness for income generation has helped to empower her economically.

I got the capital for starting this business from the money I get per month from Organisation X. I am focusing more on my business than doing ganyus in the field to supplement my income. I no longer see the need for doing ganyus because I have the money I need to take care of my family and start up a small business. My plans for the future are that I would want to expand my business by selling beans which earn alot more than doughnuts. I would want to use the money realised from selling the beans to buy ironsheets for my house. I have always wanted to live in a house with ironsheets and that is my goal so far.; At present, we are doing businesses like selling tomatoes, cooking oil, sweetpotatoes and friters based on the advice from  Organisation X that we should invest our money in businesses so that we are financially independent. Most of us have stopped doing ganyu because we are busy running our businesses as taught by Organisation X.; Before embarking on such businesses which have stemmed from Organisation X's interventions, these men used to do a lot of ganyu labour including making grass thatched fetches for houses, working in farms and other types of ganyu.; NGOs are also giving people money like GOAL and Organisation X; as a result there are fewer people doing ganyus and more people doing small scale businesses because the money from the organizations is used as capital for their businesses.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically. Every week whenever she meets her friends in the Organisation B group they discuss issues that help promote prudent financial management.; Money earned from the social cash transfer has eased the pressure on expenditures as there is a guaranteed fixed amount of income each month paid to the respondent. The money realised from the business also helps  to increase the buying power of the household members. New assets have been bought like a radio and a memory card which provides entertainment to the household besides being a source of information.","Previously the household mostly survived on proceeds from ganyu labour. She used to got to Country A to work on the farms there for food. She would spend some few days away from the family. But since last year when she became a beneficiary of Organisation X's social cash transfer, she has not gone back to Country A for ganyu labour in order to feed the family. She has mostly relied on the cash handouts to buy food. She has also established a tomato selling business within the past few months to compliment the household income. Using proceeds from the cash handouts. the husband wants to start a fish selling business in the near future. The income from the sweet potato sells will also be channeled towards the establishment of new businesses and acquisition of assets.","The household is involved in small scale business like buying and selling of farm produce like cassava and sweet potatoes. They also do ganyu work but on a much smaller scale now compared to previous years. The family also receives monthly cash handouts from Organisation X worth K15,000 since October 20xx. Before this, the major source of income was piece work.; The respondent said that in addition to the normal farming, she has a kitchen garden where the family grows vegetables for consumption in order to improve nutrition in the household. This is something new and she learnt this from Organisation X field officers. She has also learned mixed cropping using modern farming methods like conservation agriculture which does not use the traditional ridges. Farmers use maize stalks for mulching in order to conserve moisture, avoid erosion and improve soil fertility. For the first time she planted hybrid maize seeds for the first time because she was able to purchase using part of her cash handouts she receives from Organisation X. She was advised by Organisation X extension officers to plant one seed per hole at 25cm apart and this system of planting maize is called Technique3. The crops are mainly grown for home consumption. She has also purchased a goat for the first time using the same source of income. Going foward she wants to expand crop production by acquiring more farming land through land rentals. This farming season, the respondent said she had no time for piece work unlike the previous years because she could afford to buy food using part of the cash handouts she gets monthly from Organisation X.; She is a fish  monger. She generates additional household income through selling fish. This is the first time she has ventured into this kind of business and has never been involved in any kind of business before as an income generating activity. Instead she used to fetch piece work across the border in Country A. In principle the fish mongering business has technically substituted her crossborder piece work adventures. The major income comes from the social cash transfer program by Organisation X and gets K15,000 monthly since October 20xx. \"To me the social cash transfer program feels like a dead father resurrecting to feed the hungry neglected children he left behind with nobody taking care of them\". This family used to gather wild foods in Mangochi in times of acute hunger but not anymore. They are able to generate income to buy food.; Apart from the selling of farm produce, the respondent has opened a shop. He sells groceries while his wife has started making and selling fritters (Mandasi). The business capital came from the monthly income he receives from Organisation X as a beneficiary of the Social Cash Transfer program. He also sells cooking oil in small quantities. He no longer engages in piece works as he has a business as an alternative money maker to compliment to the income he gets monthly  from Organisation X. Before joining the Social Cash Transfer Program in October 20xx, he used to survive on ganyu (piece work) in order to sustain his family.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","I have always made decisions in the household so there has not been any changes in this regard. The only change I have noticed is with respect to dealing with emergencies and shocks because now I can borrow from the Organisation B but before I used to go for ganyu.; I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?","The money Organisation X gives me is more than what I was making when doing ganyu. In addition to this, my household earnings have increased also because of the fritters that I sell.

The only change I have noticed is with respect to dealing with\nemergencies and shocks because now I can borrow from the Organisation B but\nbefore I used to go for ganyu.<\/br> I have bought kitchen utensils like pots,\nplates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could\nnot afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the\nyears before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend\nmoney because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the\none who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money\nfrom Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level,\nthere are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small\nscale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year.\nMost importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by\nOrganisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month,\nI save some of it at the Organisation B group. So far, I can easily borrow money\nfrom the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation\nB group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would\nnot trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for ganyus to\nsolve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I\njust bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation\nX. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so\nthat I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my\ncommunity making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?<\/p>","<a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_edit_362\">Edit link<\/a><\/br><a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_delete_362\">Delete link<\/a><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-5<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:225<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:d3_what is the main reason for this change?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>The money Organisation X gives me is more than what I was making when doing\nganyu.

I got the capital for starting this business from the money I get per month from Organisation X. I am focusing more on my business than doing ganyus in the field to supplement my income. I no longer see the need for doing ganyus because I have the money I need to take care of my family and start up a small business. My plans for the future are that I would want to expand my business by selling beans which earn alot more than doughnuts. I would want to use the money realised from selling the beans to buy ironsheets for my house. I have always wanted to live in a house with ironsheets and that is my goal so far.; At present, we are doing businesses like selling tomatoes, cooking oil, sweetpotatoes and friters based on the advice from  Organisation X that we should invest our money in businesses so that we are financially independent. Most of us have stopped doing ganyu because we are busy running our businesses as taught by Organisation X.; Before embarking on such businesses which have stemmed from Organisation X's interventions, these men used to do a lot of ganyu labour including making grass thatched fetches for houses, working in farms and other types of ganyu.; NGOs are also giving people money like GOAL and Organisation X; as a result there are fewer people doing ganyus and more people doing small scale businesses because the money from the organizations is used as capital for their businesses.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically.

Before this, the major source of income was piece work.; The respondent said that in addition to the normal farming, she has a kitchen garden where the family grows vegetables for consumption in order to improve nutrition in the household.

She has also learned mixed cropping using modern farming methods like conservation agriculture which does not use the traditional ridges. Farmers use maize stalks for mulching in order to conserve moisture, avoid erosion and improve soil fertility.

She was advised by Organisation X extension officers to plant one seed per hole at 25cm apart and this system of planting maize is called Technique3. The crops are mainly grown for home consumption. She has also purchased a goat for the first time using the same source of income. Going foward she wants to expand crop production by acquiring more farming land through land rentals.

The major income comes from the social cash transfer program by Organisation X and gets K15,000 monthly since October 20xx. \"To me the social cash transfer program feels like a dead father resurrecting to feed the hungry neglected children he left behind with nobody taking care of them\". This family used to gather wild foods in Mangochi in times of acute hunger but not anymore. They are able to generate income to buy food.; Apart from the selling of farm produce, the respondent has opened a shop. He sells groceries while his wife has started making and selling fritters (Mandasi). The business capital came from the monthly income he receives from Organisation X as a beneficiary of the Social Cash Transfer program. He also sells cooking oil in small quantities. He no longer engages in piece works as he has a business as an alternative money maker to compliment to the income he gets monthly  from Organisation X.

I got the capital for starting this business from the money I get per month from Organisation X. I am focusing more on my business than doing ganyus in the field to supplement my income. I no longer see the need for doing ganyus because I have the money I need to take care of my family and start up a small business. My plans for the future are that I would want to expand my business by selling beans which earn alot more than doughnuts. I would want to use the money realised from selling the beans to buy ironsheets for my house. I have always wanted to live in a house with ironsheets and that is my goal so far.; At present, we are doing businesses like selling tomatoes, cooking oil, sweetpotatoes and friters based on the advice from  Organisation X that we should invest our money in businesses so that we are financially independent. Most of us have stopped doing ganyu because we are busy running our businesses as taught by Organisation X.; Before embarking on such businesses which have stemmed from Organisation X's interventions, these men used to do a lot of ganyu labour including making grass thatched fetches for houses, working in farms and other types of ganyu.; NGOs are also giving people money like GOAL and Organisation X; as a result there are fewer people doing ganyus and more people doing small scale businesses because the money from the organizations is used as capital for their businesses.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically. Every week whenever she meets her friends in the Organisation B group they discuss issues that help promote prudent financial management.; Money earned from the social cash transfer has eased the pressure on expenditures as there is a guaranteed fixed amount of income each month paid to the respondent. The money realised from the business also helps  to increase the buying power of the household members. New assets have been bought like a radio and a memory card which provides entertainment to the household besides being a source of information.","Previously the household mostly survived on proceeds from ganyu labour. She used to got to Country A to work on the farms there for food. She would spend some few days away from the family. But since last year when she became a beneficiary of Organisation X's social cash transfer, she has not gone back to Country A for ganyu labour in order to feed the family. She has mostly relied on the cash handouts to buy food. She has also established a tomato selling business within the past few months to compliment the household income. Using proceeds from the cash handouts. the husband wants to start a fish selling business in the near future. The income from the sweet potato sells will also be channeled towards the establishment of new businesses and acquisition of assets.","The household is involved in small scale business like buying and selling of farm produce like cassava and sweet potatoes. They also do ganyu work but on a much smaller scale now compared to previous years. The family also receives monthly cash handouts from Organisation X worth K15,000 since October 20xx. Before this, the major source of income was piece work.; The respondent said that in addition to the normal farming, she has a kitchen garden where the family grows vegetables for consumption in order to improve nutrition in the household. This is something new and she learnt this from Organisation X field officers. She has also learned mixed cropping using modern farming methods like conservation agriculture which does not use the traditional ridges. Farmers use maize stalks for mulching in order to conserve moisture, avoid erosion and improve soil fertility. For the first time she planted hybrid maize seeds for the first time because she was able to purchase using part of her cash handouts she receives from Organisation X. She was advised by Organisation X extension officers to plant one seed per hole at 25cm apart and this system of planting maize is called Technique3. The crops are mainly grown for home consumption. She has also purchased a goat for the first time using the same source of income. Going foward she wants to expand crop production by acquiring more farming land through land rentals. This farming season, the respondent said she had no time for piece work unlike the previous years because she could afford to buy food using part of the cash handouts she gets monthly from Organisation X.; She is a fish  monger. She generates additional household income through selling fish. This is the first time she has ventured into this kind of business and has never been involved in any kind of business before as an income generating activity. Instead she used to fetch piece work across the border in Country A. In principle the fish mongering business has technically substituted her crossborder piece work adventures. The major income comes from the social cash transfer program by Organisation X and gets K15,000 monthly since October 20xx. \"To me the social cash transfer program feels like a dead father resurrecting to feed the hungry neglected children he left behind with nobody taking care of them\". This family used to gather wild foods in Mangochi in times of acute hunger but not anymore. They are able to generate income to buy food.; Apart from the selling of farm produce, the respondent has opened a shop. He sells groceries while his wife has started making and selling fritters (Mandasi). The business capital came from the monthly income he receives from Organisation X as a beneficiary of the Social Cash Transfer program. He also sells cooking oil in small quantities. He no longer engages in piece works as he has a business as an alternative money maker to compliment to the income he gets monthly  from Organisation X. Before joining the Social Cash Transfer Program in October 20xx, he used to survive on ganyu (piece work) in order to sustain his family.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","I have always made decisions in the household so there has not been any changes in this regard. The only change I have noticed is with respect to dealing with emergencies and shocks because now I can borrow from the Organisation B but before I used to go for ganyu.; I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house.

They also do ganyu work but on\na much smaller scale now compared to previous years. The family also receives\nmonthly cash handouts from Organisation X worth K15,000 since October 20xx.\nBefore this, the major source of income was piece work.<\/br> The respondent\nsaid that in addition to the normal farming, she has a kitchen garden where the\nfamily grows vegetables for consumption in order to improve nutrition in the\nhousehold. This is something new and she learnt this from Organisation X field\nofficers. She has also learned mixed cropping using modern farming methods like\nconservation agriculture which does not use the traditional ridges. Farmers\nuse maize stalks for mulching in order to conserve moisture, avoid erosion and\nimprove soil fertility. For the first time she planted hybrid maize seeds for\nthe first time because she was able to purchase using part of her cash handouts\nshe receives from Organisation X. She was advised by Organisation X extension\nofficers to plant one seed per hole at 25cm apart and this system of planting\nmaize is called Technique3. The crops are mainly grown for home consumption. She\nhas also purchased a goat for the first time using the same source of income.\nGoing foward she wants to expand crop production by acquiring more farming land\nthrough land rentals. This farming season, the respondent said she had no time\nfor piece work unlike the previous years because she could afford to buy food\nusing part of the cash handouts she gets monthly from Organisation X.<\/br> She\nis a fish monger. She generates additional household income through selling\nfish. This is the first time she has ventured into this kind of business and\nhas never been involved in any kind of business before as an income generating\nactivity. Instead she used to fetch piece work across the border in Country\nA. In principle the fish mongering business has technically substituted her\ncrossborder piece work adventures. The major income comes from the social cash\ntransfer program by Organisation X and gets K15,000 monthly since October 20xx.\n\"To me the social cash transfer program feels like a dead father resurrecting\nto feed the hungry neglected children he left behind with nobody taking care\nof them\". This family used to gather wild foods in Mangochi in times of acute\nhunger but not anymore. They are able to generate income to buy food.<\/br> Apart\nfrom the selling of farm produce, the respondent has opened a shop. He sells\ngroceries while his wife has started making and selling fritters (Mandasi). The\nbusiness capital came from the monthly income he receives from Organisation X\nas a beneficiary of the Social Cash Transfer program. He also sells cooking oil\nin small quantities. He no longer engages in piece works as he has a business\nas an alternative money maker to compliment to the income he gets monthly from\nOrganisation X.

They no longer gather wild foods during the hungry months because the available cash is used to purchase food from the market. The social cash transfer program has brought about this change. Before this program sometimes the family would not afford three meals a day but now they are able to have three meals which include breakfast, lunch and supper.; There is more peace in the family now than before. Children are happy because they are able have regular meals.  In terms of decision making, she is the one who makes major financial decisions at the household. Household responsibilities are shared among the members notwithstanding their gender. Organisation X promotes gender equality and therefore beneficiaries have embraced the concept of sharing roles and responsibilities equally at the household.; She has enough food for household and her business is thriving since October 20xx. Overall, she is a happier person compared to previous years. Increased assets she has acquired is testimony of her improved wellbeing.; The relationship has improved over the past months because the children from this household are no longer food beggars in the community which was something that strained the relationship between parents. On the other hand, she claimed that her economic improvement has attracted some jealousy from people who do not wish her well. She is not allowed to benefit from other programs that offer financial assistance like the Organisation C Program in which people work on a community project and get paid. She is denied on account that she already benefiiting from the program implemented by Organisation X. \"You cannot have everything for yourself. Everybody needs money and you have to give a chance to other people to also benefit from other programs as you enjoy assistance from Organisation X\".","This beneficiary is also a member of a local Organisation B group where she saves her money. Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer program is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed under the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if saving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her income anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months she has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes, charcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She borrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back with an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that through this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.; I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?; I have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I get Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money to start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in the Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my money accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from Organisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the fish selling  business I am operating. My future plans are to expand my business by also selling tomatoes and bananas in addition to the fish I am already selling. I am planning on doing this because tomato selling and banana selling businesses are lucrative.","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically. Every week whenever she meets her friends in the Organisation B group they discuss issues that help promote prudent financial management.","Money earned from the social cash transfer has eased the pressure on expenditures as there is a guaranteed fixed amount of income each month paid to the respondent. The money realised from the business also helps  to increase the buying power of the household members. New assets have been bought like a radio and a memory card which provides entertainment to the household besides being a source of information.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","During the last year the household has been saving money through the Organisation B comprising of Organisation X beneficiaries only. She has also been saving money inform of assets like a goat. She is also able to access loans from the same Organisation B groups to finance her expenditures particularly using it as business capital or buying assets. Previously she could not save anything because her household income was low compared to this day.; The respondent is a member of a Organisation B group and busy shares weekly at the minimum price of K300 per share. She can afford to more than 5 shares at one go depending on availability of money. Before joining the Organisation B group she used to keep money in the house which was risky because thieves could still or could buy things that were not necessary simply because she had cash within reach. With this Organisation B she is able to borrow money and use it for her tomato selling businesss. \"As old as I am nobody could borrow me money because they thought i would not manage to pay back. But now being a member of the Organisation B, I am able to borrow money without hussles. I am able to pay back in small amounts over an agreed period of time. This has changed my life\".; I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X.

I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?; I did not have purchasing power before this program of receiving money from Organisation X. I could not buy anything. Now, I can happily say I have managed to spend some of that money on buying livestock like 2 goats, 2 ducks and a chicken. I have bought these livestock for the purpose of selling them when they multiply in the near future. There are no changes in the decision making because I am the head of this household. With the coming of Organisation X, I have started saving money through the Organisation B group ran by Organisation X. Before this organisation came in this village, I never had any money to save but because of the monthly cash transfers I am getting, I am able to save some of it with the Organisation B group so that I would use the money to finish up building my house and even use some of it to boost my beer selling business.; Important link to  - Organisation B: Access to loans has improved, people have started businesses with loans from the Organisation B","The respondent said that he is an experience sawyer and has been earning his living through logging and and making planks for his clients. Currently, since becoming a beneficiary of the Organisation X social cash transfer program, he has ventured into fish mongering. He buys and sells fish in the community for a living. His brother who is also a household member operates a bicycle taxi and the income he makes is partly used to support the household. Going forward, he intends to expand the fish mongering business and also buy more shares in the Organisation B group so that when he saves more he will be able to have a larger business capital to achieve his business plans in the future. He no longer engages in ganyu (piece work) as a source of income. His job as a sawyer has now become secondary.; Organisation B groups created by Organisation X in 20xx have offered him an opportunity to save more money by buying more shares. It is mandatory for each beneficiary to be a member of a Organisation B group in the community. Some money is also invested in a business and assets.; They also buy shares at the Organisation B group which enables them to borrow money from the same to buy whatever they need including starting up small scale businesses. If the beneficiary is the wife, she borrows money from the Organisation B group and engages in a small scale business. The profits made from the business cater for other family needs at the household.; These people have all joined the Organisation B group where they save money. In terms of expenditure, most of the money is used to buy food while part of it is used to run businesses and also buying household assets. Household assets bought by many households include mats, cups, plates, blankets and school uniforms. \"It was a shame when you receive a visitor yet you have no mat and blanket for them to use overnight.

The respondent has joined a Village Savings Loan group which was formed courtesy of Organisation X World Wide. Apart from the Organisation B group initiated by Organisation X World Wide, he is also a member of another Organisation B group which was formed by community members. The interests accrued from these savings and loans he obtains provide him with the financial muscle to purchase household assets he could not afford before. The earnings are also injected into his grocery business as well as the buying of edible tubers from Country A for sale to hunger stricken people in his community. Organisation X World Wide gave him some business training and that has helped him to make sound household budgets and manage his income and expenditure without threatening his business capital.","She is a member of a Organisation B group in the community. This group was established within last year to help beneficiaries of Organisation X's intervention develop the habit of saving their income and also borrowing from the same. Once she receives her monthly csah handout, she saves part of it in the Organisation B group by buying shares. Most of the expenditure was on food as the family has just passed through the hungry months. Some money has been used to buy hoes for farming, bought a black plastic sheet which she used to cover the roof of her house to avoid leakage during the rainy season. In times of shocks and emergencies the family borrows money from the Organisation B group.","My family and I, normally eat meal and fish as well as vegetables. However, since joining the Organisation B, I can also afford to provide breakfast in form of porridge for my entire family. Previously, we never used to have breakfast as there was not enough money to buy sugar to put in the porride. We also have tea sometimes for breakfast due to the earnings from the Organisation B group by Organisation X. During the lean season, I can afford to eat high quality meal made of white flour due to the savings from the Organisation B. Before last year, I would eat meal made of bran because I could not afford to buy good quality maize flour. Overall, these are very good changes because the food we eat is of better quality by far from what we used to eat previously.; The quality of the food my family and I eat has got better in the last year because of the Organisation B savings from Organisation X. I can afford to buy high quality maize flour and even relish like meat sometimes because of that extra money earned from the Organisation B group.; Overall, my wellbeing has changed for the better because of the increased savings I make from the Organisation B.

Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer\nprogram is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed\nunder the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if\nsaving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her\nincome anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months\nshe has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes,\ncharcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She\nborrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back\nwith an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that\nthrough this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.<\/\nbr> I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money\nI get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items\nwhich were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is\nmy husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning\nmore than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how\nmoney is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X.\nWith regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly\nvisible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which\nwas not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly\non saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X\nand instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some\nof it at the Organisation B group. So far, I can easily borrow money from the\nOrganisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group,\nI could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not\ntrust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for ganyus to\nsolve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I\njust bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation\nX. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so\nthat I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my\ncommunity making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?<\/br>\nI have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I\nget Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money\nto start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in\nthe Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my\nmoney accumulates interest.

She has also\nbeen saving money inform of assets like a goat. She is also able to access loans\nfrom the same Organisation B groups to finance her expenditures particularly\nusing it as business capital or buying assets. Previously she could not save\nanything because her household income was low compared to this day.<\/br> The\nrespondent is a member of a Organisation B group and busy shares weekly at the\nminimum price of K300 per share. She can afford to more than 5 shares at one\ngo depending on availability of money. Before joining the Organisation B group\nshe used to keep money in the house which was risky because thieves could still\nor could buy things that were not necessary simply because she had cash within\nreach. With this Organisation B she is able to borrow money and use it for her\ntomato selling businesss. \"As old as I am nobody could borrow me money because\nthey thought i would not manage to pay back. But now being a member of the\nOrganisation B, I am able to borrow money without hussles. I am able to pay back\nin small amounts over an agreed period of time. This has changed my life\".<\/\nbr> I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money\nI get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items\nwhich were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is\nmy husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning\nmore than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money\nis spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With\nregards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible\nchanges. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not\npossible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving\nmoney, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead\nof using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the\nOrganisation B group. So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation\nB group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could\nnot borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me\nwith their mopney and in this case I would go looking for ganyus to solve my\nfinancial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just\nbought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X.\nI bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that\nI sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community\nmaking a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?<\/br> I did not\nhave purchasing power before this program of receiving money from Organisation\nX. I could not buy anything. Now, I can happily say I have managed to spend\nsome of that money on buying livestock like 2 goats, 2 ducks and a chicken. I\nhave bought these livestock for the purpose of selling them when they multiply\nin the near future. There are no changes in the decision making because I am\nthe head of this household. With the coming of Organisation X, I have started\nsaving money through the Organisation B group ran by Organisation X. Before this\norganisation came in this village, I never had any money to save but because\nof the monthly cash transfers I am getting, I am able to save some of it with\nthe Organisation B group so that I would use the money to finish up building my\nhouse and even use some of it to boost my beer selling business.<\/br> Important\nlink to - Organisation B: Access to loans has improved, people have started\nbusinesses with loans from the Organisation B<\/p>","<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:nbm-24; mjm-4; nbm-3<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:395; 403; 578; 610<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:d1_please tell me about the other things your household does to earn money, food\nand to get other things? how has this changed over the last year?; f8_what is\nthe main reason for this change?; d1_d1. please tell me about the other things\nyou and others in this area do to earn money, and get food and other things:\nhow has this changed over the last year?; f1_please tell me about how households\nlike yours, spend and save money? has it changed in the last year?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>The respondent said that he is an experience sawyer and has been earning his\nliving through logging and and making planks for his clients.

implemented new farming techniques because of Organisation X; for instance I have adopted Mtayakhasu (zero tillage) this year in order to have more yields. Regarding new crops I have grown this season, for the first time, I have grown groundnuts which were made available at our market by Organisation X. I have grown groundnuts because they fetch alot of money once sold and they are nutritious. I have also grown sugarcane this season for the purpose of selling them to earn extra income based on the advice by Organisation X that we have to be self-dependent. In the case of livestock, I have bought 3 chickens this year in February so that I sell them when they multiply. I used the part of the money I receive per month from Organisation X to buy these chickens. Overall, the time I spend with farm production has increased because I am no longer doing ganyu. The advice on good agricultural practices from Organisation X has also meant that I spend more time with farm production than before where I would pay little attention to my crops and I would not follow proper procedures in farming. In future, I would want to get a tradle pump or engine pump to engage in irrigation farming and grow onions and tomatoes which fetch alot of money here.; I never had pails or decent plates but now I do because of the money I receive from Organisation X. I had no money and it used to be hard to manage and hard to save but now I can buy items for the tuckshop and even things needed for the education of my children as a result of the money from Organisation X. There are no changes in who decides on expenditures because we have always made these decisions together with my wife. I am a member of a Organisation B group managed by Organisation X whilst my wife is a member of another Organisation B established by community members and not necessarilly an NGO. In my case, there are no changes so far becasue we have not shared out the money yet but my wife has bought some pails from the money she got from her Organisation B.  Perhaps, I can say that the change I have witnessed with my joining this Organisation B is that I can borrow money more easily from the group than before when I would rely on borrowing from friends which was in most cases difficult because of lack of trust. With regards to assets sold, I have not sold any but I have bought plates for household use, 3 Chickens for the purpose of selling them when they multiply; I have also bought 3 ironsheets to put on the roof of my house which is grass-thatched at the moment. I want to buy more ironsheets to cover the entire roof so that I can also be like my friends who are doing well and have houses covered with ironsheets on the roofs.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","The household has changed the way the spend and save money since last year. The respondent has joined a Village Savings Loan group which was formed courtesy of Organisation X World Wide. Apart from the Organisation B group initiated by Organisation X World Wide, he is also a member of another Organisation B group which was formed by community members. The interests accrued from these savings and loans he obtains provide him with the financial muscle to purchase household assets he could not afford before. The earnings are also injected into his grocery business as well as the buying of edible tubers from Country A for sale to hunger stricken people in his community. Organisation X World Wide gave him some business training and that has helped him to make sound household budgets and manage his income and expenditure without threatening his business capital.; The income from the safety net program as well as the profits and interests gained over his savings have enabled him to afford the purchase of some household assets like plates, plastic basins, blankets, clothes a bicycle and a radio.; Money earned from the social cash transfer has eased the pressure on expenditures as there is a guaranteed fixed amount of income each month paid to the respondent. The money realised from the business also helps  to increase the buying power of the household members. New assets have been bought like a radio and a memory card which provides entertainment to the household besides being a source of information.; I never had pails or decent plates but now I do because of the money I receive from Organisation X.

All these changes are a result of the money that Organisation X gives me every month.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","Important link to Organisation X - Organisation B: I can afford to pay for farm labour, buy land for agriculture, build a house, improve nutrition of  my household","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>"],"color":["#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488","#058488"],"hashtags":["NA","NA","NA;

Regarding new crops I have\ngrown this season, for the first time, I have grown groundnuts which were made\navailable at our market by Organisation X. I have grown groundnuts because\nthey fetch alot of money once sold and they are nutritious. I have also grown\nsugarcane this season for the purpose of selling them to earn extra income\nbased on the advice by Organisation X that we have to be self-dependent. In\nthe case of livestock, I have bought 3 chickens this year in February so that I\nsell them when they multiply. I used the part of the money I receive per month\nfrom Organisation X to buy these chickens. Overall, the time I spend with farm\nproduction has increased because I am no longer doing ganyu. The advice on good\nagricultural practices from Organisation X has also meant that I spend more time\nwith farm production than before where I would pay little attention to my crops\nand I would not follow proper procedures in farming. In future, I would want to\nget a tradle pump or engine pump to engage in irrigation farming and grow onions\nand tomatoes which fetch alot of money here.<\/br> I never had pails or decent\nplates but now I do because of the money I receive from Organisation X.

They no longer gather wild foods during the hungry months because the available cash is used to purchase food from the market. The social cash transfer program has brought about this change. Before this program sometimes the family would not afford three meals a day but now they are able to have three meals which include breakfast, lunch and supper.; There is more peace in the family now than before. Children are happy because they are able have regular meals.  In terms of decision making, she is the one who makes major financial decisions at the household. Household responsibilities are shared among the members notwithstanding their gender. Organisation X promotes gender equality and therefore beneficiaries have embraced the concept of sharing roles and responsibilities equally at the household.; She has enough food for household and her business is thriving since October 20xx. Overall, she is a happier person compared to previous years. Increased assets she has acquired is testimony of her improved wellbeing.; The relationship has improved over the past months because the children from this household are no longer food beggars in the community which was something that strained the relationship between parents. On the other hand, she claimed that her economic improvement has attracted some jealousy from people who do not wish her well. She is not allowed to benefit from other programs that offer financial assistance like the Organisation C Program in which people work on a community project and get paid. She is denied on account that she already benefiiting from the program implemented by Organisation X. \"You cannot have everything for yourself. Everybody needs money and you have to give a chance to other people to also benefit from other programs as you enjoy assistance from Organisation X\".","This beneficiary is also a member of a local Organisation B group where she saves her money. Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer program is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed under the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if saving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her income anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months she has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes, charcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She borrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back with an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that through this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.; I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money I get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items which were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is my husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning more than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the Organisation B group.  So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for  ganyus to solve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?; I have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I get Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money to start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in the Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my money accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from Organisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the fish selling  business I am operating. My future plans are to expand my business by also selling tomatoes and bananas in addition to the fish I am already selling. I am planning on doing this because tomato selling and banana selling businesses are lucrative.","The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a business for income generation has helped to empower her economically. Every week whenever she meets her friends in the Organisation B group they discuss issues that help promote prudent financial management.","Money earned from the social cash transfer has eased the pressure on expenditures as there is a guaranteed fixed amount of income each month paid to the respondent. The money realised from the business also helps  to increase the buying power of the household members. New assets have been bought like a radio and a memory card which provides entertainment to the household besides being a source of information.","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","<p>\n  link_quotes\n  Multiple quotes\n<\/p>","During the last year the household has been saving money through the Organisation B comprising of Organisation X beneficiaries only.

She is also able to access loans from the same Organisation B groups to finance her expenditures particularly using it as business capital or buying assets. Previously she could not save anything because her household income was low compared to this day.; The respondent is a member of a Organisation B group and busy shares weekly at the minimum price of K300 per share. She can afford to more than 5 shares at one go depending on availability of money. Before joining the Organisation B group she used to keep money in the house which was risky because thieves could still or could buy things that were not necessary simply because she had cash within reach. With this Organisation B she is able to borrow money and use it for her tomato selling businesss. \"As old as I am nobody could borrow me money because they thought i would not manage to pay back. But now being a member of the Organisation B, I am able to borrow money without hussles. I am able to pay back in small amounts over an agreed period of time.

I could not buy anything. Now, I can happily say I have managed to spend some of that money on buying livestock like 2 goats, 2 ducks and a chicken. I have bought these livestock for the purpose of selling them when they multiply in the near future. There are no changes in the decision making because I am the head of this household. With the coming of Organisation X, I have started saving money through the Organisation B group ran by Organisation X. Before this organisation came in this village, I never had any money to save but because of the monthly cash transfers I am getting, I am able to save some of it with the Organisation B group so that I would use the money to finish up building my house and even use some of it to boost my beer selling business.; Important link to  - Organisation B: Access to loans has improved, people have started businesses with loans from the Organisation B","The respondent said that he is an experience sawyer and has been earning his living through logging and and making planks for his clients. Currently, since becoming a beneficiary of the Organisation X social cash transfer program, he has ventured into fish mongering. He buys and sells fish in the community for a living. His brother who is also a household member operates a bicycle taxi and the income he makes is partly used to support the household. Going forward, he intends to expand the fish mongering business and also buy more shares in the Organisation B group so that when he saves more he will be able to have a larger business capital to achieve his business plans in the future. He no longer engages in ganyu (piece work) as a source of income. His job as a sawyer has now become secondary.; Organisation B groups created by Organisation X in 20xx have offered him an opportunity to save more money by buying more shares. It is mandatory for each beneficiary to be a member of a Organisation B group in the community. Some money is also invested in a business and assets.; They also buy shares at the Organisation B group which enables them to borrow money from the same to buy whatever they need including starting up small scale businesses. If the beneficiary is the wife, she borrows money from the Organisation B group and engages in a small scale business. The profits made from the business cater for other family needs at the household.; These people have all joined the Organisation B group where they save money. In terms of expenditure, most of the money is used to buy food while part of it is used to run businesses and also buying household assets.

Apart from the Organisation B group initiated by Organisation X World Wide, he is also a member of another Organisation B group which was formed by community members. The interests accrued from these savings and loans he obtains provide him with the financial muscle to purchase household assets he could not afford before. The earnings are also injected into his grocery business as well as the buying of edible tubers from Country A for sale to hunger stricken people in his community. Organisation X World Wide gave him some business training and that has helped him to make sound household budgets and manage his income and expenditure without threatening his business capital.","She is a member of a Organisation B group in the community. This group was established within last year to help beneficiaries of Organisation X's intervention develop the habit of saving their income and also borrowing from the same.

Most of the expenditure was on food as the family has just passed through the hungry months. Some money has been used to buy hoes for farming, bought a black plastic sheet which she used to cover the roof of her house to avoid leakage during the rainy season. In times of shocks and emergencies the family borrows money from the Organisation B group.","My family and I, normally eat meal and fish as well as vegetables. However, since joining the Organisation B, I can also afford to provide breakfast in form of porridge for my entire family. Previously, we never used to have breakfast as there was not enough money to buy sugar to put in the porride. We also have tea sometimes for breakfast due to the earnings from the Organisation B group by Organisation X. During the lean season, I can afford to eat high quality meal made of white flour due to the savings from the Organisation B. Before last year, I would eat meal made of bran because I could not afford to buy good quality maize flour. Overall, these are very good changes because the food we eat is of better quality by far from what we used to eat previously.; The quality of the food my family and I eat has got better in the last year because of the Organisation B savings from Organisation X.

The social cash transfer\nprogram has brought about this change. Before this program sometimes the\nfamily would not afford three meals a day but now they are able to have three\nmeals which include breakfast, lunch and supper.<\/br> There is more peace\nin the family now than before. Children are happy because they are able have\nregular meals. In terms of decision making, she is the one who makes major\nfinancial decisions at the household.

Overall, she is a\nhappier person compared to previous years. Increased assets she has acquired\nis testimony of her improved wellbeing.<\/br> The relationship has improved over\nthe past months because the children from this household are no longer food\nbeggars in the community which was something that strained the relationship\nbetween parents.

Part of the money she recieves from the social cash transfer\nprogram is being saved. The Organisation B group which she joined was formed\nunder the guidance of Organisation X with the aim of promoting the spirit if\nsaving among the beneficiaries. Before this program she was not not saving her\nincome anywhere because she had nothing to save. Within the past few months\nshe has been able to buy some assets like cooking pots, blankets, clothes,\ncharcoal stove, 6 plates and wrappers. She has also managed to buy a goat. She\nborrows money from the Organisation B group to buy the assets and pays back\nwith an interest over an agreed period for that particular loan. She said that\nthrough this savings group it is very easy to save and borrow money nowadays.<\/\nbr> I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money\nI get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items\nwhich were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is\nmy husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning\nmore than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how\nmoney is spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X.\nWith regards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly\nvisible changes. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which\nwas not possible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly\non saving money, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X\nand instead of using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some\nof it at the Organisation B group. So far, I can easily borrow money from the\nOrganisation B group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group,\nI could not borrow money from people in my community because they would not\ntrust me with their mopney and in this case I would go looking for ganyus to\nsolve my financial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I\njust bought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation\nX. I bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so\nthat I sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my\ncommunity making a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?<\/br>\nI have started selling fish last month so that I earn a little something. I\nget Cash Transfers from Organisation X per month and I used some of that money\nto start my fish selling business. I have also invested some of my money in\nthe Organisation B group operated by Organisation X in this village so that my\nmoney accumulates interest. I have stopped doing ganyu because I get money from\nOrganisation X per month which has made me to focus my energies and time on the\nfish selling business I am operating. My future plans are to expand my business\nby also selling tomatoes and bananas in addition to the fish I am already\nselling. I am planning on doing this because tomato selling and banana selling\nbusinesses are lucrative.<\/p>","<a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_edit_36\">Edit link<\/a><\/br><a class=\"action-button linky\" href=\"#\" id=\"link_click_delete_36\">Delete link<\/a><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:mjf-7<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:11<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:f5_what is the main reason for this change?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>The trainings she receives from Organisation X and the ability to manage a\nbusiness for income generation has helped to empower her economically.

She has also\nbeen saving money inform of assets like a goat. She is also able to access loans\nfrom the same Organisation B groups to finance her expenditures particularly\nusing it as business capital or buying assets. Previously she could not save\nanything because her household income was low compared to this day.<\/br> The\nrespondent is a member of a Organisation B group and busy shares weekly at the\nminimum price of K300 per share. She can afford to more than 5 shares at one\ngo depending on availability of money. Before joining the Organisation B group\nshe used to keep money in the house which was risky because thieves could still\nor could buy things that were not necessary simply because she had cash within\nreach. With this Organisation B she is able to borrow money and use it for her\ntomato selling businesss. \"As old as I am nobody could borrow me money because\nthey thought i would not manage to pay back. But now being a member of the\nOrganisation B, I am able to borrow money without hussles. I am able to pay back\nin small amounts over an agreed period of time. This has changed my life\".<\/\nbr> I have bought kitchen utensils like pots, plates, buckets using the money\nI get from Organisation X. In the past I could not afford to get these items\nwhich were important for household use. In the years before last year, it is\nmy husband who made all decisions on how to spend money because he was earning\nmore than me but things have changed now. I am the one who decides on how money\nis spent because I am the one receiving the money from Organisation X. With\nregards to how we manage money at household level, there are certainly visible\nchanges. I can save money for investing in a small scale business which was not\npossible before Organisation X came here last year. Most importantly on saving\nmoney, I have joined the Organisation B group run by Organisation X and instead\nof using up some of the money they give me per month, I save some of it at the\nOrganisation B group. So far, I can easily borrow money from the Organisation\nB group when I am in need of it. Before this Organisation B group, I could\nnot borrow money from people in my community because they would not trust me\nwith their mopney and in this case I would go looking for ganyus to solve my\nfinancial problems. I have not sold any assets in the last year but I just\nbought 2 chickens in November 20xx using the money I got from Organisation X.\nI bought the chickens with the aim of rearing them until they multiply so that\nI sell them to buy iron sheets for my house. I have seen people in my community\nmaking a fortune out of selling chickens so I thought why not?<\/br> I did not\nhave purchasing power before this program of receiving money from Organisation\nX. I could not buy anything. Now, I can happily say I have managed to spend\nsome of that money on buying livestock like 2 goats, 2 ducks and a chicken. I\nhave bought these livestock for the purpose of selling them when they multiply\nin the near future. There are no changes in the decision making because I am\nthe head of this household. With the coming of Organisation X, I have started\nsaving money through the Organisation B group ran by Organisation X. Before this\norganisation came in this village, I never had any money to save but because\nof the monthly cash transfers I am getting, I am able to save some of it with\nthe Organisation B group so that I would use the money to finish up building my\nhouse and even use some of it to boost my beer selling business.<\/br> Important\nlink to - Organisation B: Access to loans has improved, people have started\nbusinesses with loans from the Organisation B<\/p>","<div>This bundle consists of multiple original links<\/div><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>Memo:<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Source ID:nbm-24; mjm-4; nbm-3<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Statement ID:395; 403; 578; 610<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Hashtags:NA<\/p><p class='link_tooltip'>Question ID:d1_please tell me about the other things your household does to earn money, food\nand to get other things? how has this changed over the last year?; f8_what is\nthe main reason for this change?; d1_d1. please tell me about the other things\nyou and others in this area do to earn money, and get food and other things:\nhow has this changed over the last year?; f1_please tell me about how households\nlike yours, spend and save money? has it changed in the last year?<\/p><\/br><p class='link_tooltip'>The respondent said that he is an experience sawyer and has been earning his\nliving through logging and and making planks for his clients.

His brother who is also a household member operates a bicycle taxi and\nthe income he makes is partly used to support the household. Going forward, he\nintends to expand the fish mongering business and also buy more shares in the\nOrganisation B group so that when he saves more he will be able to have a larger\nbusiness capital to achieve his business plans in the future. He no longer\nengages in ganyu (piece work) as a source of income. His job as a sawyer has now\nbecome secondary.<\/br> Organisation B groups created by Organisation X in 20xx\nhave offered him an opportunity to save more money by buying more shares. It is\nmandatory for each beneficiary to be a member of a Organisation B group in the\ncommunity.

The members have also been healthy over the past few months. This is because, among other reasons, they have been exposed to good hygienic practices both inside and outside the household. For example, Organisation X is implementing a WASH project in which they require that all beneficiaries must have a toilet with a hand washing facility close to it, use dish racks and keeping the environment clean. Organisation X is championing this sensitizaton campaign in the community. The household members collectively  endure that all the hygienic practices are strictly observed as taught by Organisation X. The respondent further said that her family eats better food nowadays because they have money from the social cash transfer which was introduced in 20xx and this has resulted into a healthier life.
