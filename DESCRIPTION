Title: Functions for Causal Mapping
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Steve Powell
Maintainer: Steve Powell <steve@pogol.net>
Description: A set of functions for manipulating and simplifying causal maps. These functions are used in the Causal Map Viewer (https://causalmap.shinyapps.io/CausalMapViewer/) and are similar to those used in the Causal Map app(http://causalmap.app). 
    In our roadmap, these functions will eventually replace their counterparts in the Causal Map app.
