2,"In my family we are considerably healthy because people get sick from time to time. Even this year we got sick, although we do not visit the hospital we do get better eventually. Instead we go to church as we are prohibited of going to the hospital because of cultural issues, and beliefs (they believe church are more serious and that some diseases are linked to spiritual problems) and also going to the hospital takes longer time to be assisted. We do get sick because it is the way God made things to occur we do not know why. We try to change but we still do get sick even though we make use of mosquito nets. We also dig holes in which we put litter and we also have better latrines/toilets. We take three baths per day, and also wash our hands after visiting the washrooms. We do use mosquito nets. Yes, there are. We previously took a bath per day, and we would go to the bushes to alleviate our selves. We changed our behaviours because we learned from Organisation 1 that the way one behaves contributes to a health status. Caring for our health is considerably important.

I accepted the learning because I aimed to have other crops to have increase earning income. Also had training from Organisation 2 on growing of crops. For example this year I had very little production of maize yet thanks to sweet potatoes we are surviving. We sell sweet potatoes to buy other things and others we utilize for our consumption. We had changes in the Agriculturel practice we started using the same lines but now with correct sizes for each crop. Also learned with mothers group to store food, before I did not use fertilizers or medicines on my crops to last longer; and after putting the medicines I place in  package. Before I would put the crops in the silo yet without medicines. This change was  a result from training held in the mothers group belonging to Organisation 2 Project. The use of fertilizers made positive changes as now products or seeds are stored longer without deteriorate easily.","Planted new crop/vegetable varieties_Farm production

91,"Comparing to last year, I now don't only sell maize and millets, I also sell different products such as carrots, sweet potato, cabbage, cauliflower. I am starting  to have more money compared to previous years, this is due to the training held in the mothers group and seeds distributed by them. I was able to  have other sources of money yet the only inconvenient is the cost value for selling these products that sometimes is not worth it meaning that I could get more money. I sell a lower price that ends up not been much profitable but is better than nothing. We will see if this situation can change in the coming years by looking for new markets or increasing the selling price.

Since the training on mothers group I started eating new things such as eggs and mixture of soya with peanuts and we eat like this in either abundant or hunger period. Besides eggs, start eating margarine and juices for consumption on day to day in my house. I start taking little wild products first because I consume little, before we eat a lot of it due to hunger.

Before we only gave  babies enriched porridge after a month life and babies had difficulties in their growing but today is different as we can see the babies growing. In the morning babies eat enriched porridge and adults sweet potatoes giving them healthier life.  All have the same treatment, some eat porridge and other sweet potato. As well as that they eat other things but we reinforce more often giving soups and porridges to babies because they are not heavy meals. Women breastfeeding and those pregnant live with 3 meals and at times more than 3 meals.  These changed after the training held on mothers group and some explanation from the hospital.

For such things, we have attended the health centre services to avoid getting worst. Also to avoid diseases, we eat many fruits such as oranges that contain vitamins, we knew about it before yet we did not practice just because of lack of habit, yet now with reinforcement from the staff at the health centre we have started adopting these practices. We do regular visits to the health centres taking our children for normal check ups. To improve my day to day health and keep good I eat peanut and soya that will serve as vitamins. In the case of hygiene, I have changed; now I use the toilet especially washing hands (previous I did not wash my hands), clean my yard, and wash the bathroom. These changes come as a result of training held by Organisation 2 started this January. We adopted to the changes because besides flu that we have because of climate changes, at the past we would constantly get sick of diarrhoea and cholera. For all these practices of eating healthy food and doing improved latrines we had with support of health technician as well with staff from Organisation 2.

Last year we produced more and had good consumption and also had good productivity but this season/year we produced little and had less productivity which was caused by raining that damaged and destroyed our production. As per quantities or type of crop it also changed because the income of last year was better than this year, this year I had to increase crops because the income was higher than last year. As per type of crops also changed  having increased the crops such as sweet potatoes (because sweet potatoes are tolerant to any climate change) to help households and other horticulture crops and cereals. As per animal breeding, I have animals and I have changed the quann  tidy of production, it increased because there was breeding by its reproduction. And I have also bought other animals to help in the reproduction. As per practice of agriculture, this did not change as this is the way we produce or practice. As per the way of storing, it has changed because the appropriate way of storing/conserve is placing products in the silos or put it in bags and place chemical products for conservation against rats/insects.

As per what I am eating today it changed, today I am eating little due to the raining that destroyed all crops. But on other hand today I am eating new foods as advised by medical doctors, this advice came to improve or maintain balanced dietary. Because of the raining that destroyed all crops and thinking that we would sell whatever crop is left with us, the health service is worried that we will only eat one type of crop therefore to avoid it they have introduced mobilization campaigns telling us at the community leave to have diverse food. Now we eat sweet potatoes, soya and peanuts. As per processing or storing or conservation it changed a lot for better because the period of hunger is longer and we have to manage with the little we have. As per the quantity of food we buy from the market it changed but as much as last year because last year we bought more because we sold and we had money, now this season we don't have money because we do not produce much due to raining. As per the quantity of wild fruits we harvest a bit more because we are many in the community looking for it.

For babies under 6 months old  it did not change because we don't have babies at such age range on the other hand for babies ages 6 months to 2 years old it changed as now they eat more fruits like bananas, sweet potatoes and also they make three meals a day and other small snacks throughout the day. The types of  food for children more than years, they eat more porridge and more fruits its found at the community after harvest and this did not in our household as children still eat the same portion of food. As per number of meals we have three meals daily. Yes taboos of not eating eggs during pregnancy because children would be born without hair. There are changes because now pregnant women do eat eggs, even children do eat and nothing wrong occurs to them.

817,"The main motive for this is the fact that we now plant more varieties of products we learned that diversifying  production 1) increases food security because out of different crops produced one may not give harvest as expected but at least one crop will harvest; 2) enables having to choose what to eat aligned to other available  products in the house; 3 ) diversified crops allows one crop to support other with nutrients )and we now have better food at home. With a lot of good product, we are now able to sell more and we save more to ensure there is food in the house.","Increased knowledge; Farming method/practice_Planted new crop/vegetable varieties

Yes there has been changes because my family can eat and study whilst we can afford clothes, we can also afford to save some money, the other into Bank D for desperate times, so we can have some money.

821,"There has been, during last year with the farmers group in the community we were able to produce and sell and we were also able to eat as we have two farms. Through production we were able to sustain ourselves, we have been eating well because of what we sold is enough to buy other foods like rice, spaghetti, chicken, beans, fish. We keep corn in bags for better conservation. The way we used to conserve goods brought us a lot of losses. We changed as I now buy because we have more money, different from other years. We no longer eat spare foods, no one plants here as we no longer harvest. We plant better products now.","Increased knowledge; Farming method/practice_Produced enough food to eat and/or sell

828,"My family eats well and we have a better life. My baby ate good food, but between the age range of 0 to 6 months she only fed on breast milk because we learn in the hospital and the mother's group in the community, we were taught by Organisation 1. There has been changes yes, because my other children (elder) had it differently as I could not give them then, what I can now. The 2 year old children can eat a lot of food as: potatoes, fruits, maize mean with curry, porridge etc. Normally, we now have three meals per day and this has nothing to do with being pregnant or not, she eats everything we eat.  Taboo's no longer exist but in our community, although they were previously there in the old times. I think these changes are good as there are no more taboo's as people are free to eat as they want, and the kids are born without any problems.","Increased knowledge; Nutrition_Increased knowledge; Nutrition
