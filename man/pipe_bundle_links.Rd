\usage{
pipe_bundle_links(graf, field = NULL, group = field)
}
\arguments{
\item{graf}{A mapfile representing a causal map.
A mapfile is a tidygraph, which consists of a table of edges linked to a table of nodes,
with an optional additional table of statements.
In this package, nodes are called `factors` and edges are called `links.`}

\item{field}{}
}
\value{
A mapfile in which sets of coterminal, same-direction links are replaced with
one link (when `field` = 'n') or more than one link for each of the values of `field`
present in the data. In each case, each new link has a field n representing the number
of links it is replacing, unless the links it is replacing already had values n in which
case the new value of `n` is the sum of the `n` values of the constituent links.
