\item{graf}{A mapfile representing a causal map.
A mapfile is a tidygraph, which consists of a table of edges linked to a table of nodes,
with an optional additional table of statements.
In this package, nodes are called `factors` and edges are called `links.`}

If it is character, the other parameters are ignored and a color-blind friendly qualitative palette is applied.}

\item{lo}{Optionally, a color specification for the low end of the color range. Default is `green`.}

\item{hi}{Optionally, a color specification for the high end of the color range. Default is `blue`.}

\item{mid}{Optionally, a color specification for the middle of the color range. Default is `gray`.}

\item{fixed}{Optionally, a color specification which will be applied everywhere and overrides `field`.}
